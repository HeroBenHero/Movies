                            <p>Description: Oliwia (Anna Szymanczyk) worked as a chef in Wroclaw, and she was doing great in her career. For the last five years, her boss was dependent on her, and he knew that his cafe was so well known because of the exquisite dishes that Oliwia used to make.
One day, Oliwia got a call from her village, situated in the Podlaskie province, and she was informed that her grandmother had passed away. She asked her boss for a leave and rushed to her village immediately, as she knew that she was the only family member her grandmother had.
Oliwia's mother and grandmother used to fight all the time, and as a result, Oliwia never stayed a lot with her grandmother as her mother went off to live on the other side of the world.
Oliwia grew to up be a girl with a hot temper and no patience.Oliwia got the shock of her life when she realized that it was all an act, and her grandmother was pretty much alive. Her grandmother, Halina (Anna Seniuk), had lied to her, saying she wanted Oliwia to come back to the village and stay with her. Oliwia got mad at first, but then she realized that her grandmother missed her way too much. Oliwia's car was broken down (most probably it was messed up by one of the villagers to prompt Oliwia to stay the night).
Halina says that it was Oliwia's mother who turned her against her grandmother.
Still, Oliwia knew that she would go back in a couple of days, but she had no clue about what Halina had in her mind. She went missing just a day before Oliwia's departure, and she left a note for the latter, telling her that she was leaving her farm in her care. The farm had a horse named Dumpling which was bought for Oliwia when it was a colt.Oliwia was stuck, and additionally, she didn't know how to manage an entire farm. Luckily, she met a man who told her that he was Wojtek (Mateusz Janicki), the caretaker who generally provided a helping hand to Halina. Oliwia was glad that she found someone on whom she could put all the responsibilities and leave, but she had no clue that the entire village was conspiring together with Halina.
Oliwia meets her childhood friend Matylda Wasyl (Angelika Cegielska-Swiatek), and they used to go apple picking together. Matylda is with the local police and tells Oliwia that Halina is alive and well and is using the internet at Matylda's house to keep tabs on Oliwia.Eventually, Oliwia starts riding Dumpling and enjoying the farm life. Wojtek even fixes her car. Oliwia bonds with her farm animals when a recently born baby goat got sick and really weak. Oliwia had to feed the baby goat by herself to save her life.
The town had many colorful characters including 2 brothers who brewed their own moonshine. Oliwia suggests them to mix their flavors to create an even more amazing brew.Everybody knew that Halina was hiding in Jan's (Artur Barcis) house, but no one informed Oliwia about it, as they, too, wanted her to stay back with her grandmother. The man who said he was Wojtek was actually the owner of the Herbal World, and his real name was Kuba Wolak. Kuba made sure that Olivia's car didn't start the next day, hoping that it would coerce her to stay back.Although Oliwia was annoyed when her car didn't start, she decided to see the brighter side of things. She knew she had a hectic life in the city, and she realized that it wouldn't be such a bad thing to stay back and take some downtime. Halina was happy that her plan was working, and she wished and hoped that her granddaughter would stay there for good.
Oliwia gets a hang of farm work, including the milking of goats. Matylda comes by and convinces her to take a longer vacation from work. Her boss is distraught but gives her another week.Now, firstly, Kuba had lied about his identity, and secondly, Oliwia got to know that he was an arch-nemesis of her grandmother. Oliwia got to know that, first, Kuba and his father had filed a suit against her grandmother for the damages (to tune of 25,000 Zlotys) caused to their business.
Oliwia's mother had sold their meadow to Kuba's father, and this is what Halina and Oliwia's mother fought about, as the meadow was sold without Halina's consent.
Oliwia realizes that man she thought was Wojtek is really Kuba. She had gone with an offer to sell the entire farm for 150,000 Zoltys, but Kuba tells Oliwia that Halina can earn that money from the farm to pay of her debts.Oliwia realized that maybe Kuba was a monopolist, and he was envious of the fact that Halina's cheese production business was doing so well. Halina won awards every year for her product, and it was said that her cheese was the best in the entire region. This is when the health department had come for inspection at Halina's farm, and after that, they had put a ban on the production of cheese.Halina's cheese was of the best quality, and it felt like either the health inspector had a grudge against her, or somebody had bribed him or used their influence to destroy Halina's business. The suspicion fell on Kuba, as he was the one who had these legal battles going on. Kuba had fallen for Oliwia, and he wanted to tell her that he was not the person she believed him to be. Kuba tried telling Oliwia that it was all a big misunderstanding. He told her that he had not called the health department, and in fact, it was Halina who had filed a complaint against him at first.Kuba had separated from his wife sometime back, and his girl stayed with him. Kuba wanted things to work out between him and Oliwia, and so one day, on the advice of his daughter, he decided to express his feelings to her. Oliwia also liked Kuba, but the fact was that she was never going to stay in the village, and a long-distance relationship was something that she felt was not doable.
Kuba tried to approach Oliwia, but he was stopped by Halina's friends who did not want Oliwia mixing up with Halina's arch-nemesis.
Oliwia restarts making cheese from goat milk, using Halina's recipe. The first batch is only so-so. Kuba's daughter comes by and suggests that Oliwia can improve the taste using herbs from Kuba's herb garden. Oliwia becomes best friends with Kuba's daughter and learns that Kuba is in love with her.Over a period of time, Kuba realized that not only did he have a strong bond with Oliwia on a personal level, but they were also too good when it came to professional partnerships. One time, people from Warsaw were coming to meet Kuba as they saw potential in his herb world initiative, and they wanted to invest money in the new venture that he was going to open in Bialystok. At the last moment, Kuba realized that his father had fired the chef and there was nobody to cook food for them. He asked Oliwia to help him out, and considering she was a professional chef, she made the most delicious lunch for the guests. The Varsovians were impressed, and they decided to invest money in Kuba's venture.When Halina came back from hiding, she got to know that it was a lady named Maryla Jura (Beata Kawka) who had snitched and informed the health department.
Halina accepted Kuba and Oliwia's relationship, as she knew that there was a possibility that because of Kuba, Oliwia might stay back. But Oliwia was a practical girl, and she decided that her life was in the city. She had huge dreams, and so to fulfill them once again, with tears in her eyes, she went back.
Kuba stood there on his farm, watching Oliwia drive her car away. He wanted to stop her; he wanted to tell her how much he needed her in his life, but he knew that he couldn't do that. Kuba knew that their relationship wouldn't be sustainable if he forced her to stay. Kuba wanted her to get the realization, and he was prepared that probably she wouldn't ever return to the village.But something happened to Oliwia once she got back to her city. She felt a void inside her, and she just couldn't focus on anything.
Yes, her career was there, but there was nobody around her whom she could call her own. She craved her grandmother's presence; she longed to be with Kuba, and she felt deprived of that warmth that she got there from everybody else.That's when Oliwia decided to go back to her village. It was a tough decision for her, but she was very clear about her priorities. In the end, Kuba was elated when he found that Oliwia had come back, and he just couldn't stop blushing when he heard the hooves of her horse approaching him. Halina got what she wanted, and probably in the future, Oliwia wouldn't have to compromise on her career, and she would take her grandmother's home-grown business to greater heights.</p>

Dispatching experts to the site, the company operating the well realizes that it has only one solution to avert the catastrophe: detonate the oil well with nitroglycerin within 24 hours. Against a large sum of money, a powerhouse team is then sent 800 km away to transport 200 kg of explosives in two trucks. The team now has less than 20 hours to reach the oil well. 20 hours to traverse hostile zones controlled by armed rebels, cross minefields, and drive two trucks loaded with nitroglycerin over rough terrain!. The race against the clock has begun.</p>

                            <p>Description: Johnny (Peter Butler) and Zuko (Bonko Khoza) were members of a group of armed activists called Alkebulan, determined to eradicate corruption in South Africa. Johnny was once a popular lawyer and the Director of International Relations, but when Daza Mtima (Sisanda Henna) was released from prison and gained power, Johnny got repeatedly demoted. Clearly, Johnny's stance did not align with Mtima's. He started a counterintelligence operation with elite assassins to take down Mtima, and Zuko was one of them.Zuko was born to activist parents and had grown up to always voice for the right cause. He had taken an oath during his initiation in which he promised to fight for justice and to protect the innocent. Johnny Klein found hope when he got access to files that exposed Mtima. Johnny trusted Zuko to ensure that Mtima was not exonerated by the courts, even though it had been a long time since Zuko had left the group.Johnny was diagnosed with cancer, and he had Mtima's PIA agents (reporting into Mo) tracking his every movement. However, Johnny managed to escape an attack when the PIA agents tracked the wrong person. Agent Naledi was on point for intel on Johnny's location.
Mtima is planning to fight an election and puts pressure on Mo to deliver Johnny to him.Johnny knew that he was running out of time, and the truth would be buried with him if Mtima found him before he could connect with Zuko. With time running out, Johnny met Zuko at his workplace. This meeting was observed by PIA agents. Zuko was not ready to leave behind the beautiful life he had built and endanger the future he envisioned with girlfriend Malime (and their son Pakamile), but he had a change of heart upon finding out that Johnny was suffering from a terminal illness.
Johnny handed him the key to the locker at the airport and instructed Zuko to head to Maseru, where he would find elders to show him the right path. Johnny distracted the PIA agents, while Zuko headed to the airport. Just when the agents thought they had succeeded in cornering Johnny, he shot himself and simultaneously jumped off the highway. Johnny had done his part for the welfare of South Africa. He had assigned Zuko the task of bringing out the truth, and he had also contacted Cape Town Sentinel journalist Mike Bressler (Deon Coetzee), whose career Mtima had ruined during his investigation into the state capture.Zuko had no choice but to bid goodbye to Malime (Masasa Mbangeni), knowing that their lives would be at risk if he continued to stay in touch with them. Malime never questioned Zuko about his past, but she could guess that he was in trouble when Johnny knocked at their door. Zuko chose not to disclose much about his life as an assassin, and when he suddenly decided to leave Malime was left wondering if he was just like all the other men who promised her the world but failed to live up to it.
Pakamile (Boleng Mogotsi) and Zuko shared a beautiful relationship, and he looked up to Zuko. He was the only one who knew that Zuko planned on proposing Malime and when he left all of a sudden, Pakamile did not lose hope. He had complete faith in Zuko and he was confident that he would return to their lives.
At the airport locker, Zuko found a passport and an flight ticket to Maseru.The PIA agents arrived at Malime's house and forcefully dragged her out. They wanted to find out more about the files Johnny had, and they believed that kidnapping Malime would help them stop Zuko. Malime barely had any knowledge about her partner's criminal past, but she tried to cooperate in the hopes of getting back to Pakamile.
Naledi (Nicole Fortuin), who was a member of the radical activist group, had infiltrated the PIA. Zuko contacted Naledi after he embarked on the mission. She advised him to focus on the task while she tried to find a way to make sure that his partner remained safe. She got in touch with Malime and tried to give her some hope.Unfortunately, Mo got a whiff of Naledi's true identity and interrogated her. Naledi refused to give away any information, and she was taken away to be further tortured. Mo was unaware of how skilled a fighter Naledi was, and it was only a matter of minutes before she managed to tackle the guards.
Naledi assisted Malime in escaping, but the entire situation was too overwhelming for Malime. The chaos and confusion resulted in Malime failing to land after jumping off a building to save her life. Malime did not survive the fall, and Mo decided to kidnap Pakamile to keep Zuko under pressure. Pakamile was in extreme pain after losing his mother all of a sudden and being locked up in a tiny room without any contact with his loved ones.
After escaping Naledi contacted Bressler. Naledi tells Bressler that Johhny and Zuko were running a counterintelligence operation against Mtima with elite assassins. She says that Malime died due to Mo.The Director of the PIA (Presidential Intelligence Agency), Molebogeng Kwena (Connie Ferguson), found out that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Thandiwe Makeba (Connie Chiume), was also involved with Johnny and his group. The connection between Makeba and Johnny was something Mo was keen on finding out.
She was surprised to learn that Mtima knew about Makeba's involvement, and he also had incriminating evidence against the former minister for her involvement in illegal mining. But even with the evidence against her, Makeba continued to be a threat to Mtima, and Mo was instructed to silence her. She had no choice but to obey Mtima because of her tainted past- her father was closely involved with the apartheid regime. Mo met Makeba to find out about Johnny's plan, but all the former politician disclosed was that Mtima would lose everything he had built by Friday.Thandi believed that it was her duty to protect South Africa from people like Mtima, who would not mind selling the nation for their own benefit. She and Johnny had created a deadly weapon, Zuko, to ensure that the innocent would not suffer from injustice. Thandi hoped for Mo to side with the cause after finding out about their pure intention, but it was all too late for Mo; she was already knee-deep in helping Mtima. Mo struck Thandi with a blunt object, and the former minister bled to death.Zuko felt reconnected with his ancestors when he reached Maseru and met the elders at the village. They tended to his wounds and handed him the letter Johnny had left for him. Zuko was reminded of the cause he was fighting for and how it was greater than everything else. He found the files Johnny had promised, and before releasing them to the public, he burned down the file of Alkebulan.
Just when Zuko accepted his role in the grand scheme of things, Mo informed him how every member of the group had been compromised. Zuko was furious when he found out that Malime met with an accident and Pakamile was kidnapped. He realized that the only way to stop Mtima was by exposing him, and he contacted Mike Bressler to hand over the files Johnny had left. They secretly met at a restaurant, and before handing over the documents, Zuko laid forth a condition: he was desperate to be reunited with his family, and he hoped for Bressler to help him.Bressler helped Zuko connect with Naledi, and it was from her that he found out about Malime's death. Zuko realized that before destroying Mtima, it was important that he get his son back. Naledi had been keeping track of Mo, and she had located a cabin she frequented. Bressler recognized the cabin; it was where Mtima lived when he visited Cape Town. Zuko broke into Mtima's cabin to seek his ultimate revenge.With the spear handed to him by his elders, Zuko slayed Mtima's guards one after the other. Mtima was easy to knock out, and by the time he came back to his senses, Zuko had his spear pressed on Mtima's throat. The presidential hopeful was well aware that Zuko was desperate to get his son back, and he knew that he would not be harmed as long as he had Pakamile. Zuko instructed Mo to get his son back, and in the meantime, Mtima tried to lure Zuko with money.Mtima's PIA agents arrived at the cabin, and what followed was an intense fight where Zuko triumphed. Mo brought along Pakamile to stop Zuko and force him to hand over the files. Zuko explained that he had already handed over the files for printing, and Mtima's political career was over. Mo was holding a gun, and she pointed it at Zuko. Mtima encouraged her to shoot him dead and prove to the world that she was not a traitor like her father. Mo crossed all boundaries, fearing being publicly shamed for her father's association with the apartheid regime, but she realized that as long as Mtima lived, there would never be an end to her misery.Mo shoots Mtima dead. She wanted to kill Zuko as well, but Naledi came to his rescue. Mo was shot dead, and it was all over for Mtima and his supporters.
The next morning, the murders of Daza Mtima and Molebogeng Kwena made it to the headlines. There were officially no suspects, suggesting that Zuko and Naledi had managed to walk away Scot-free. The files Johnny had gathered made it to the public, and those involved in the State capture were apprehended. While some sense of justice was brought into the world, Zuko headed back to his childhood home at the Great Fish River with his son by his side. He wanted to live a life of a recluse and dedicate all his time to farming, just like he and Pakamile had always planned.</p>

                            <p>Description: Amanda Raymond moved back to her family's flower farm after her father Craig Raymond's passing a year ago. That milestone not only was to help her mother Grace Raymond run the farm, but led to her turning her back on the church for God taking her father away from them. Amanda and Grace are facing problems this Easter season, one of their most economically profitable seasons of the year, with the unseasonable cold weather meaning no flowers yet. Behind on the mortgage payment, they are at risk of losing the farm, Craig's legacy. While Craig was the floral designer in the family, Amanda, who has no training or natural ability at such, works toward a Hail Mary in planning to enter the annual Easter statewide flower arranging competition, the $20,000 first prize which would tie them over financially. The only reason why Amanda is considering it is because Lori Matthews, a trained now retired florist who has just moved to town and who Amanda helped out of a bind in their first meeting, has offered to be her teacher. Many of Lori's lessons take them away from the floral table, sometimes to the church where her son Derrick Matthews is the new pastor, that initial entrance back into the church still being a painful one for Amanda. Both Lori and Derrick are facing their own demons, one which Lori may have to face in moving to town, and one Derrick has run away from in moving to town. In the process of the floral competition, their collective issues may come to a head as Amanda and Derrick start to fall for each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1930, a young Usha (Sara Ali Khan) watched her schoolteacher, an earnest man and supporter of Gandhi, get beaten up by the police. As a young child, barely 3 feet high, she still tried to stop the police and got hurt in the process. At home, her father, a judge named Hariprasad (Sachin Khedekar), locks her up in a room to try to curb her courage. The next day, they watch Siberian cranes from their window, and Usha exclaims that she wants to fly too. Hariprasad introduces Usha to the radio as a medium through which she can get news from the whole world.Many years later (in 1942, Bombay), a 22-year-old Usha is at the heart of the freedom fight, something her father, who is still compliant with the British and enjoys the benefits of the same (receiving a car for his work), doesn't know about. Usha has a few friends along with her, including a man named Fahad (Sparsh Srivastav) and the love of her life, Kaushik (Abhay Verma). Other colleagues include Antara (Aditi Sanwal), Bhaskar (Pratik Yadav) and Kamat (Sangram Salvi).
The gang gets involved with the Congress party at the insistence of Balbir, their leader. Usha lies to her father and swears she has nothing to do with them.Usha and the gang get to see Gandhi (Uday Chandra) a little while later, and she pledges to become a "Brahmachari." This includes a vow of celibacy and makes Kaushik very upset. Though initially he's heartbroken that she would make such a decision without speaking with him, he ends up continuing to fight anyway.
This is when Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement. The British consider this as an act of treason since the 2nd world war is still going on. The British ban the Congress Party, and in the process, all of the big names and the Congress party leaders got arrested. During this time, Usha and the gang attempt to keep the Indian Flag upright but get brutally beaten up by the police. Still, the gang doesn't plan on giving up soon, or at least Usha and Fahad.
Seeing as all the press is controlled by the enemy, there's one thing lacking in the country and that is communication. As the British spread their lies, the country's unity is broken, so Usha comes up with the idea of starting an illegal radio broadcast. Immediately, two of the members of the gang (Antara and Bhaskar) decide to leave because they don't plan on getting hanged.Usha, Kaushik, and Fahad find themselves in a difficult position when the radio transmitter they want to purchase is going to cost them (Rs 4000, or the cost of 1 Kg of Gold) much more than they expected. Still, Usha is determined to get her hands on it. This is when her grand aunt (Madhu Raja) offers to sell some of her gold because this is the only way she can contribute to the Quit India Movement.
Overjoyed, Usha and the gang get the engineer, Firdaus (Anand Tiwari), to set up the radio for them and teach them how to use it.
42.34 is the frequency, and the gang broadcast recorded messages from the Congress leaders every night at 8:30 p.m. The message spreads quickly in certain parts of the country, specifically between Mangalore and Ajmer, even getting attention from Ram Manohar Lohia (Emraan Hashmi), a political agitator on the radar of the British.On the other hand, Usha is struggling to communicate with her father, who seems to be more distant than ever before. Usha tells Hariprasad that she is doing late night classes with a professor, while she was working on her radio broadcasts. When he learns that she is lying (Hariprasad invites the professor to home) and running a radio station, he tries to stop her again, but this time she runs away, calling his love an obstacle to her flight. She's willing to give her life for the country, and her father can't do anything to stop her now.
As an independent woman, Usha becomes more involved with the party and finally gets to meet Lohia, an inspirational figure. When he learns that it is she and her friends who are running the radio, he decides to work with them to make the Congress radio the voice of the country. Seeing as all the leaders are locked up and there's no other way to communicate, this would be the only way to get the country to act on the Quit India Movement.
Lohia brings in his technical experts to increase the range and the sound quality of the broadcast.With the help of Lohia's radio expert, the team has the perfect system to deliver clear messages across the country. Suddenly, everyone is tuned in to 42.34 at 8:30 p.m. every night, making it a nuisance for the British. The British thought that they had crushed the Quit India Movement, but Congress Radio has reignited it.
This could lead to countrywide protests and agitation, so the British started to search for the radio operators. John Lyre (Alexx O'Nell), the man who arrested Gandhi and the rest, is put on a mission to catch the radio operators. Corrigan (Benedict Garrett) is the Chief of Military Intelligence who informs John that the transmitter is in Bombay.
Kamble (Manoj Diwakar) is a policeman working for John. He warns Balbir that the police are on the hunt for Congress Radio.Lyre realizes that there are only a few radio engineers in the city and manages to catch Firdaus, who gives up the position of their new transmitter (the only way they could've countered triangulation). Earlier, in the process of saving Firdaus, Balbir (Godaan Kumar), an ardent member of the fight, sacrifices himself.On the other hand, seeing Usha put herself in more danger (she was almost arrested by the police when she went to procure a transmitter range enhancer from a person, who turned out to be aligned with the police) as the days go by, Kaushik decides to leave her side because he can't watch her set herself up for inevitable death. Somehow, for a little while, the kids succeed in hiding the radio from Lyre, but soon, using American technology (including a radio signal detection van) and triangulation, Lyre is able to find the radio.Usha is stopped in her stride while trying to escape from the building where they're operating the radio. Somehow, Fahad and she are able to escape and hide the transmitter from the police, though their entire plan seems to be in jeopardy. They now know that John is using 2 radio detection vans and can pinpoint their location within 5 minutes.
Usha suggests using 2 transmitters so that are not allowed to fixate on one location.Diwali is chosen as the day for revolution, and in pockets all across the country, people start to prepare for a revolution. On the other hand, Lohia's location is compromised, but he continues to work from the shadows, now leaving everything up to Usha and Fahad.
Firdaus is arrested by John and the location of one of the transmitters is also compromised.
Usha and Fahad will both give their lives for the country in the blink of an eye, but Usha manages to hurt Fahad's feelings by using his limp against him. Fahad gives her his blessings because he claims he'd have done the same thing.Usha knows there's no way she won't be caught this time, and she's okay with that as long as Lohia's complete message reaches the country. Kaushik shows up now, telling Usha that for some, revolution is their love, and for others, love is their revolution. The two of them block the doors to make sure the police can't get in easily because, as soon as the broadcast starts, there's only 5 minutes until they're found out. Lohia's message is quite a long one, and all Usha wants is for him to make the declaration.Ultimately, the police break in right after the declaration is made, and the revolution begins. Usha and Kaushik are caught as the national song Vande Mataram plays on the radio. Kaushik is unable to stand the torture and signs a paper naming Lohia as the instigator of the revolution. In the meantime, Usha does not budge.Usha was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. While in prison, she receives a letter of apology from her father. He's never felt more pride than as the father of Usha. He even gets a visit from Lohia and finally breaks away from the comfortable shackles of the British. When Usha is released from prison, 20,000 people come to receive her, despite it being illegal for so many to gather. Kaushik and Fahad are in the crowd too, and Usha's father claims that she's not just a revolutionary; she is herself the revolution.
Lohia was caught in 1944 and continued to fight much later.</p>

                            <p>Description: Rudy's (Rudy Mancuso) life is somewhat of a mess and his girlfriend Haley (Francesca Reale) is tired of him zoning out on her. Rudy's Brazilian mother Maria (Maria Mancuso) doesn't like the white girl anyway, and so when she hears that Haley has broken up with Rudy, she thinks it's the perfect opportunity to introduce him to women of his own heritage, the beautiful Brazilians.
Rudy hears music in everything; it's almost like a form of therapy for him, and his escape from the real world. When he walks down the subway steps, it's a piano. When he sits in a diner with his girlfriend, he can't help but be distracted by the music of cooking and serving. This is exactly why Haley doesn't feel like he cares for her at all.
Additionally, he's always dividing his attention between her and his mother, so she feels unseen.Rudy is in his last year of school, and his only interests are puppets and music, something Haley doesn't understand. She wants him to become more serious in life and get a real job when they live together at university (which happens in 6 weeks). Rudy spends most of his time working on these "hobbies" and works late into the morning down in the subway for some petty cash, which doesn't really help his cause. Haley and Rudy have been together for 4 years. Rudy does puppet shows in the subway and is working on his music thesis. But Haley doesn't believe that Rudy has made enough progress.Plus, he lives at home with his mother. But at least that means he always has a lot of food on his plate. Being broken up makes Rudy realize he should take things a bit seriously. He tries to study hard, but it doesn't really work. Maria sets Rudy up with a nice Brazilian girl named Luana (Camila Senna), which is really embarrassing for him. Luana is really aggressive in her approach, but Rudy pushes her back. This prompts Luana to walk away, telling Maria that Rudy needs help.
His mother sends him to buy fish one day, and there, like the feeling of spring after a cold winter, he sees Isabella (Camila Mendes), a Brazilian. Isabella woks at the fish market and gaping at her Rudy is hit in the face with a fish.Rudy returns to the store later and walks Isabella to a market fair that she was planning on visiting. Isabella is very different from Haley. She's actually interested in seeing the world through Rudy's eyes. Rudy shows how he can turn everyday regular sounds into a rhythm.
Isabella suggests Rudy take his show "up" and actually work on it. In the meantime, at school, Haley notices him trying to ask questions in class (it's only because it's about music). Haley tells Rudy that she wants to give another shot to their relationship.Now Rudy is stuck between his ex of four years, who wants to make things work out, and a fresh perspective, who is more understanding of him because of their matching backgrounds. Isabella tells him how her mother abandoned her when she was 15, and she went back to Brazil for a man. Rudy spends a lot of time chit-chatting with his puppet about Isabella.Anwar (J.B. Smoove) is Rudy's friend and runs a fast-food truck. Rudy confides in Anwar that at this point he finds both Isabella and Haley equally alluring. Anwar asks him to pursue both, while his puppet advises strongly against it.One night, when he's trying to take Isabella out on a date using his friend's truck, he ends up getting shot in the arm. It's only grazing, but this gets Isabella and Rudy closer. They share a kiss and admit that they both feel connected to each other. She covers Rudy's ears when he goes to his faraway place and calms him down.Still, somehow, Rudy ends up two-timing the two girls "by accident". While things are going wonderfully with Isabella, he ends up going to Haley's house for a meal, which goes terribly. Her parents (Bruce (Gregory Jones) and Claire (Regina Schneider)) are racist and don't see how he's right for their daughter.
Rudy asks to meet Haley at a Brazilian restaurant in his part of town to break up with her. Isabella happens to be in the same restaurant getting takeout. Somehow, this doesn't knock some sense into Rudy, and he ends up trying to divide his time between the two girls.
In the end, his mother shows up, and the three women surround him in the middle of the restaurant. Rudy, who explodes finally, revealing to Haley that he invited her there to break up with her because he found "another woman." Unfortunately, Isabella doesn't care if she's the chosen one; she leaves the restaurant.After a drunken night makes Rudy hallucinate that his life is a routine mess, his mother tries to knock some sense into Rudy. She asks him what he wants in life, and he lists a few things. One is to be happy; the other is to spend time with his mother, his puppets and music, and ultimately Isabella. She's kind of his savior, or that's what the dream made it seem like.
Rudy writes a song for Isabella to apologize, but she asks him to speak to her like a real adult. She tells him that he's trying hard to keep something together that he doesn't even know if he really wants. His apology doesn't work because Isabella has always been left with her feelings ignored.It's time for Rudy to submit his thesis, but instead, he turns it into a script titled "Musica," inspired by his own life. Finally, Rudy takes his show above ground and presents a comedy show with his puppets recreating scenes from his life with music and laughter.
Ultimately, after his show is a success, he receives takeout with a smiley face on the cover. This is the same smiley face Isabella drew for him after he got smacked by a piece of fish in the face.</p>

                            <p>Description: Within the walls of the Grave, the orphanage where Nica grew up, a legend has always been told: that of the maker of tears, a mysterious craftsman, guilty of crafting all the fears and anxieties that inhabit the hearts of men. But at seventeen years old, the time has come for Nica to leave fairy tales behind. Her biggest dream is about to come true. Mr and Mrs Milligan have started the adoption process and are ready to give her the family she has always wanted. In her new home, however, Nica is not alone. Along with her, Rigel, a restless and mysterious orphan, the last person in the world Nica would want as an adoptive brother, is also taken from the Grave. Rigel is intelligent, smart, plays the piano like an enchanting demon and has a beauty that can enchant, but his angelic appearance conceals a dark nature. Even though Nica and Rigel are united by a common past of pain and hardship, living together seems impossible, but kindness and anger are two different ways of fighting pain to stay alive and to conceal the emotions that devastate their hearts, becoming for each other that tears-maker of legend. To the maker of tears you cannot lie: and they will have to find the courage to accept that desperate force that attract them towards each other called love.</p>

                            <p>Description: Regency England. Of the two Dashwood sisters of marriageable age, Elinor, as the oldest, is the sensible, practical one, and Marianne is the die-hard romantic. In keeping to her word to her dying father Henry to keep the family together and seeing the writing on the wall that her half-brother John will not keep to his word in falling prey to the control wielded by his money-hungry wife Fanny, Elinor makes arrangements for herself, her two sisters, and their mother to move to humble Barton Cottage in Devonshire, from their Sussex country manor on Norland Park in knowing that John and Fanny will take over the manor despite having their own home in London, and that John will renege on his promise to Henry to ensure that his half-sisters and stepmother will be taken care of financially. In Devonshire, Marianne attracts the romantic attention of two men, the first, Colonel Brandon, who she sees as unromantic unlike herself. As such, she favors the second, John Willoughby, who she sees as having the same romantic sensibilities as her. Elinor, on the other hand, sees her first priority to her sisters and mother, and thus puts her feelings for Edward Ferrars, Fanny's stepbrother, on the back burner. Despite Edward stating that he wants happiness in his life over any ambition, career or financial, a union between the two of them seems unlikely regardless in Fanny implying that her mother, Edward's stepmother, would disinherit him in marrying someone beneath him like Elinor in the Dashwood women having no money. Secrets kept by Edward, Colonel Brandon, and Willoughby will affect not only Elinor and Marianne's marriage prospects, but also how they view the men in their lives.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers. In the process, the two start to fall for each other. What happens between them is affected by the fate of the book in the club which may inadvertently impact the store.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers. In the process, the two start to fall for each other. What happens between them is affected by the fate of the book in the club which may inadvertently impact the store.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Regency England. Of the two Dashwood sisters of marriageable age, Elinor, as the oldest, is the sensible, practical one, and Marianne is the die-hard romantic. In keeping to her word to her dying father Henry to keep the family together and seeing the writing on the wall that her half-brother John will not keep to his word in falling prey to the control wielded by his money-hungry wife Fanny, Elinor makes arrangements for herself, her two sisters, and their mother to move to humble Barton Cottage in Devonshire, from their Sussex country manor on Norland Park in knowing that John and Fanny will take over the manor despite having their own home in London, and that John will renege on his promise to Henry to ensure that his half-sisters and stepmother will be taken care of financially. In Devonshire, Marianne attracts the romantic attention of two men, the first, Colonel Brandon, who she sees as unromantic unlike herself. As such, she favors the second, John Willoughby, who she sees as having the same romantic sensibilities as her. Elinor, on the other hand, sees her first priority to her sisters and mother, and thus puts her feelings for Edward Ferrars, Fanny's stepbrother, on the back burner. Despite Edward stating that he wants happiness in his life over any ambition, career or financial, a union between the two of them seems unlikely regardless in Fanny implying that her mother, Edward's stepmother, would disinherit him in marrying someone beneath him like Elinor in the Dashwood women having no money. Secrets kept by Edward, Colonel Brandon, and Willoughby will affect not only Elinor and Marianne's marriage prospects, but also how they view the men in their lives.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Within the walls of the Grave, the orphanage where Nica grew up, a legend has always been told: that of the maker of tears, a mysterious craftsman, guilty of crafting all the fears and anxieties that inhabit the hearts of men. But at seventeen years old, the time has come for Nica to leave fairy tales behind. Her biggest dream is about to come true. Mr and Mrs Milligan have started the adoption process and are ready to give her the family she has always wanted. In her new home, however, Nica is not alone. Along with her, Rigel, a restless and mysterious orphan, the last person in the world Nica would want as an adoptive brother, is also taken from the Grave. Rigel is intelligent, smart, plays the piano like an enchanting demon and has a beauty that can enchant, but his angelic appearance conceals a dark nature. Even though Nica and Rigel are united by a common past of pain and hardship, living together seems impossible, but kindness and anger are two different ways of fighting pain to stay alive and to conceal the emotions that devastate their hearts, becoming for each other that tears-maker of legend. To the maker of tears you cannot lie: and they will have to find the courage to accept that desperate force that attract them towards each other called love.</p>

                            <p>Description: Rudy's (Rudy Mancuso) life is somewhat of a mess and his girlfriend Haley (Francesca Reale) is tired of him zoning out on her. Rudy's Brazilian mother Maria (Maria Mancuso) doesn't like the white girl anyway, and so when she hears that Haley has broken up with Rudy, she thinks it's the perfect opportunity to introduce him to women of his own heritage, the beautiful Brazilians.
Rudy hears music in everything; it's almost like a form of therapy for him, and his escape from the real world. When he walks down the subway steps, it's a piano. When he sits in a diner with his girlfriend, he can't help but be distracted by the music of cooking and serving. This is exactly why Haley doesn't feel like he cares for her at all.
Additionally, he's always dividing his attention between her and his mother, so she feels unseen.Rudy is in his last year of school, and his only interests are puppets and music, something Haley doesn't understand. She wants him to become more serious in life and get a real job when they live together at university (which happens in 6 weeks). Rudy spends most of his time working on these "hobbies" and works late into the morning down in the subway for some petty cash, which doesn't really help his cause. Haley and Rudy have been together for 4 years. Rudy does puppet shows in the subway and is working on his music thesis. But Haley doesn't believe that Rudy has made enough progress.Plus, he lives at home with his mother. But at least that means he always has a lot of food on his plate. Being broken up makes Rudy realize he should take things a bit seriously. He tries to study hard, but it doesn't really work. Maria sets Rudy up with a nice Brazilian girl named Luana (Camila Senna), which is really embarrassing for him. Luana is really aggressive in her approach, but Rudy pushes her back. This prompts Luana to walk away, telling Maria that Rudy needs help.
His mother sends him to buy fish one day, and there, like the feeling of spring after a cold winter, he sees Isabella (Camila Mendes), a Brazilian. Isabella woks at the fish market and gaping at her Rudy is hit in the face with a fish.Rudy returns to the store later and walks Isabella to a market fair that she was planning on visiting. Isabella is very different from Haley. She's actually interested in seeing the world through Rudy's eyes. Rudy shows how he can turn everyday regular sounds into a rhythm.
Isabella suggests Rudy take his show "up" and actually work on it. In the meantime, at school, Haley notices him trying to ask questions in class (it's only because it's about music). Haley tells Rudy that she wants to give another shot to their relationship.Now Rudy is stuck between his ex of four years, who wants to make things work out, and a fresh perspective, who is more understanding of him because of their matching backgrounds. Isabella tells him how her mother abandoned her when she was 15, and she went back to Brazil for a man. Rudy spends a lot of time chit-chatting with his puppet about Isabella.Anwar (J.B. Smoove) is Rudy's friend and runs a fast-food truck. Rudy confides in Anwar that at this point he finds both Isabella and Haley equally alluring. Anwar asks him to pursue both, while his puppet advises strongly against it.One night, when he's trying to take Isabella out on a date using his friend's truck, he ends up getting shot in the arm. It's only grazing, but this gets Isabella and Rudy closer. They share a kiss and admit that they both feel connected to each other. She covers Rudy's ears when he goes to his faraway place and calms him down.Still, somehow, Rudy ends up two-timing the two girls "by accident". While things are going wonderfully with Isabella, he ends up going to Haley's house for a meal, which goes terribly. Her parents (Bruce (Gregory Jones) and Claire (Regina Schneider)) are racist and don't see how he's right for their daughter.
Rudy asks to meet Haley at a Brazilian restaurant in his part of town to break up with her. Isabella happens to be in the same restaurant getting takeout. Somehow, this doesn't knock some sense into Rudy, and he ends up trying to divide his time between the two girls.
In the end, his mother shows up, and the three women surround him in the middle of the restaurant. Rudy, who explodes finally, revealing to Haley that he invited her there to break up with her because he found "another woman." Unfortunately, Isabella doesn't care if she's the chosen one; she leaves the restaurant.After a drunken night makes Rudy hallucinate that his life is a routine mess, his mother tries to knock some sense into Rudy. She asks him what he wants in life, and he lists a few things. One is to be happy; the other is to spend time with his mother, his puppets and music, and ultimately Isabella. She's kind of his savior, or that's what the dream made it seem like.
Rudy writes a song for Isabella to apologize, but she asks him to speak to her like a real adult. She tells him that he's trying hard to keep something together that he doesn't even know if he really wants. His apology doesn't work because Isabella has always been left with her feelings ignored.It's time for Rudy to submit his thesis, but instead, he turns it into a script titled "Musica," inspired by his own life. Finally, Rudy takes his show above ground and presents a comedy show with his puppets recreating scenes from his life with music and laughter.
Ultimately, after his show is a success, he receives takeout with a smiley face on the cover. This is the same smiley face Isabella drew for him after he got smacked by a piece of fish in the face.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1930, a young Usha (Sara Ali Khan) watched her schoolteacher, an earnest man and supporter of Gandhi, get beaten up by the police. As a young child, barely 3 feet high, she still tried to stop the police and got hurt in the process. At home, her father, a judge named Hariprasad (Sachin Khedekar), locks her up in a room to try to curb her courage. The next day, they watch Siberian cranes from their window, and Usha exclaims that she wants to fly too. Hariprasad introduces Usha to the radio as a medium through which she can get news from the whole world.Many years later (in 1942, Bombay), a 22-year-old Usha is at the heart of the freedom fight, something her father, who is still compliant with the British and enjoys the benefits of the same (receiving a car for his work), doesn't know about. Usha has a few friends along with her, including a man named Fahad (Sparsh Srivastav) and the love of her life, Kaushik (Abhay Verma). Other colleagues include Antara (Aditi Sanwal), Bhaskar (Pratik Yadav) and Kamat (Sangram Salvi).
The gang gets involved with the Congress party at the insistence of Balbir, their leader. Usha lies to her father and swears she has nothing to do with them.Usha and the gang get to see Gandhi (Uday Chandra) a little while later, and she pledges to become a "Brahmachari." This includes a vow of celibacy and makes Kaushik very upset. Though initially he's heartbroken that she would make such a decision without speaking with him, he ends up continuing to fight anyway.
This is when Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement. The British consider this as an act of treason since the 2nd world war is still going on. The British ban the Congress Party, and in the process, all of the big names and the Congress party leaders got arrested. During this time, Usha and the gang attempt to keep the Indian Flag upright but get brutally beaten up by the police. Still, the gang doesn't plan on giving up soon, or at least Usha and Fahad.
Seeing as all the press is controlled by the enemy, there's one thing lacking in the country and that is communication. As the British spread their lies, the country's unity is broken, so Usha comes up with the idea of starting an illegal radio broadcast. Immediately, two of the members of the gang (Antara and Bhaskar) decide to leave because they don't plan on getting hanged.Usha, Kaushik, and Fahad find themselves in a difficult position when the radio transmitter they want to purchase is going to cost them (Rs 4000, or the cost of 1 Kg of Gold) much more than they expected. Still, Usha is determined to get her hands on it. This is when her grand aunt (Madhu Raja) offers to sell some of her gold because this is the only way she can contribute to the Quit India Movement.
Overjoyed, Usha and the gang get the engineer, Firdaus (Anand Tiwari), to set up the radio for them and teach them how to use it.
42.34 is the frequency, and the gang broadcast recorded messages from the Congress leaders every night at 8:30 p.m. The message spreads quickly in certain parts of the country, specifically between Mangalore and Ajmer, even getting attention from Ram Manohar Lohia (Emraan Hashmi), a political agitator on the radar of the British.On the other hand, Usha is struggling to communicate with her father, who seems to be more distant than ever before. Usha tells Hariprasad that she is doing late night classes with a professor, while she was working on her radio broadcasts. When he learns that she is lying (Hariprasad invites the professor to home) and running a radio station, he tries to stop her again, but this time she runs away, calling his love an obstacle to her flight. She's willing to give her life for the country, and her father can't do anything to stop her now.
As an independent woman, Usha becomes more involved with the party and finally gets to meet Lohia, an inspirational figure. When he learns that it is she and her friends who are running the radio, he decides to work with them to make the Congress radio the voice of the country. Seeing as all the leaders are locked up and there's no other way to communicate, this would be the only way to get the country to act on the Quit India Movement.
Lohia brings in his technical experts to increase the range and the sound quality of the broadcast.With the help of Lohia's radio expert, the team has the perfect system to deliver clear messages across the country. Suddenly, everyone is tuned in to 42.34 at 8:30 p.m. every night, making it a nuisance for the British. The British thought that they had crushed the Quit India Movement, but Congress Radio has reignited it.
This could lead to countrywide protests and agitation, so the British started to search for the radio operators. John Lyre (Alexx O'Nell), the man who arrested Gandhi and the rest, is put on a mission to catch the radio operators. Corrigan (Benedict Garrett) is the Chief of Military Intelligence who informs John that the transmitter is in Bombay.
Kamble (Manoj Diwakar) is a policeman working for John. He warns Balbir that the police are on the hunt for Congress Radio.Lyre realizes that there are only a few radio engineers in the city and manages to catch Firdaus, who gives up the position of their new transmitter (the only way they could've countered triangulation). Earlier, in the process of saving Firdaus, Balbir (Godaan Kumar), an ardent member of the fight, sacrifices himself.On the other hand, seeing Usha put herself in more danger (she was almost arrested by the police when she went to procure a transmitter range enhancer from a person, who turned out to be aligned with the police) as the days go by, Kaushik decides to leave her side because he can't watch her set herself up for inevitable death. Somehow, for a little while, the kids succeed in hiding the radio from Lyre, but soon, using American technology (including a radio signal detection van) and triangulation, Lyre is able to find the radio.Usha is stopped in her stride while trying to escape from the building where they're operating the radio. Somehow, Fahad and she are able to escape and hide the transmitter from the police, though their entire plan seems to be in jeopardy. They now know that John is using 2 radio detection vans and can pinpoint their location within 5 minutes.
Usha suggests using 2 transmitters so that are not allowed to fixate on one location.Diwali is chosen as the day for revolution, and in pockets all across the country, people start to prepare for a revolution. On the other hand, Lohia's location is compromised, but he continues to work from the shadows, now leaving everything up to Usha and Fahad.
Firdaus is arrested by John and the location of one of the transmitters is also compromised.
Usha and Fahad will both give their lives for the country in the blink of an eye, but Usha manages to hurt Fahad's feelings by using his limp against him. Fahad gives her his blessings because he claims he'd have done the same thing.Usha knows there's no way she won't be caught this time, and she's okay with that as long as Lohia's complete message reaches the country. Kaushik shows up now, telling Usha that for some, revolution is their love, and for others, love is their revolution. The two of them block the doors to make sure the police can't get in easily because, as soon as the broadcast starts, there's only 5 minutes until they're found out. Lohia's message is quite a long one, and all Usha wants is for him to make the declaration.Ultimately, the police break in right after the declaration is made, and the revolution begins. Usha and Kaushik are caught as the national song Vande Mataram plays on the radio. Kaushik is unable to stand the torture and signs a paper naming Lohia as the instigator of the revolution. In the meantime, Usha does not budge.Usha was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. While in prison, she receives a letter of apology from her father. He's never felt more pride than as the father of Usha. He even gets a visit from Lohia and finally breaks away from the comfortable shackles of the British. When Usha is released from prison, 20,000 people come to receive her, despite it being illegal for so many to gather. Kaushik and Fahad are in the crowd too, and Usha's father claims that she's not just a revolutionary; she is herself the revolution.
Lohia was caught in 1944 and continued to fight much later.</p>

                            <p>Description: Amanda Raymond moved back to her family's flower farm after her father Craig Raymond's passing a year ago. That milestone not only was to help her mother Grace Raymond run the farm, but led to her turning her back on the church for God taking her father away from them. Amanda and Grace are facing problems this Easter season, one of their most economically profitable seasons of the year, with the unseasonable cold weather meaning no flowers yet. Behind on the mortgage payment, they are at risk of losing the farm, Craig's legacy. While Craig was the floral designer in the family, Amanda, who has no training or natural ability at such, works toward a Hail Mary in planning to enter the annual Easter statewide flower arranging competition, the $20,000 first prize which would tie them over financially. The only reason why Amanda is considering it is because Lori Matthews, a trained now retired florist who has just moved to town and who Amanda helped out of a bind in their first meeting, has offered to be her teacher. Many of Lori's lessons take them away from the floral table, sometimes to the church where her son Derrick Matthews is the new pastor, that initial entrance back into the church still being a painful one for Amanda. Both Lori and Derrick are facing their own demons, one which Lori may have to face in moving to town, and one Derrick has run away from in moving to town. In the process of the floral competition, their collective issues may come to a head as Amanda and Derrick start to fall for each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Johnny (Peter Butler) and Zuko (Bonko Khoza) were members of a group of armed activists called Alkebulan, determined to eradicate corruption in South Africa. Johnny was once a popular lawyer and the Director of International Relations, but when Daza Mtima (Sisanda Henna) was released from prison and gained power, Johnny got repeatedly demoted. Clearly, Johnny's stance did not align with Mtima's. He started a counterintelligence operation with elite assassins to take down Mtima, and Zuko was one of them.Zuko was born to activist parents and had grown up to always voice for the right cause. He had taken an oath during his initiation in which he promised to fight for justice and to protect the innocent. Johnny Klein found hope when he got access to files that exposed Mtima. Johnny trusted Zuko to ensure that Mtima was not exonerated by the courts, even though it had been a long time since Zuko had left the group.Johnny was diagnosed with cancer, and he had Mtima's PIA agents (reporting into Mo) tracking his every movement. However, Johnny managed to escape an attack when the PIA agents tracked the wrong person. Agent Naledi was on point for intel on Johnny's location.
Mtima is planning to fight an election and puts pressure on Mo to deliver Johnny to him.Johnny knew that he was running out of time, and the truth would be buried with him if Mtima found him before he could connect with Zuko. With time running out, Johnny met Zuko at his workplace. This meeting was observed by PIA agents. Zuko was not ready to leave behind the beautiful life he had built and endanger the future he envisioned with girlfriend Malime (and their son Pakamile), but he had a change of heart upon finding out that Johnny was suffering from a terminal illness.
Johnny handed him the key to the locker at the airport and instructed Zuko to head to Maseru, where he would find elders to show him the right path. Johnny distracted the PIA agents, while Zuko headed to the airport. Just when the agents thought they had succeeded in cornering Johnny, he shot himself and simultaneously jumped off the highway. Johnny had done his part for the welfare of South Africa. He had assigned Zuko the task of bringing out the truth, and he had also contacted Cape Town Sentinel journalist Mike Bressler (Deon Coetzee), whose career Mtima had ruined during his investigation into the state capture.Zuko had no choice but to bid goodbye to Malime (Masasa Mbangeni), knowing that their lives would be at risk if he continued to stay in touch with them. Malime never questioned Zuko about his past, but she could guess that he was in trouble when Johnny knocked at their door. Zuko chose not to disclose much about his life as an assassin, and when he suddenly decided to leave Malime was left wondering if he was just like all the other men who promised her the world but failed to live up to it.
Pakamile (Boleng Mogotsi) and Zuko shared a beautiful relationship, and he looked up to Zuko. He was the only one who knew that Zuko planned on proposing Malime and when he left all of a sudden, Pakamile did not lose hope. He had complete faith in Zuko and he was confident that he would return to their lives.
At the airport locker, Zuko found a passport and an flight ticket to Maseru.The PIA agents arrived at Malime's house and forcefully dragged her out. They wanted to find out more about the files Johnny had, and they believed that kidnapping Malime would help them stop Zuko. Malime barely had any knowledge about her partner's criminal past, but she tried to cooperate in the hopes of getting back to Pakamile.
Naledi (Nicole Fortuin), who was a member of the radical activist group, had infiltrated the PIA. Zuko contacted Naledi after he embarked on the mission. She advised him to focus on the task while she tried to find a way to make sure that his partner remained safe. She got in touch with Malime and tried to give her some hope.Unfortunately, Mo got a whiff of Naledi's true identity and interrogated her. Naledi refused to give away any information, and she was taken away to be further tortured. Mo was unaware of how skilled a fighter Naledi was, and it was only a matter of minutes before she managed to tackle the guards.
Naledi assisted Malime in escaping, but the entire situation was too overwhelming for Malime. The chaos and confusion resulted in Malime failing to land after jumping off a building to save her life. Malime did not survive the fall, and Mo decided to kidnap Pakamile to keep Zuko under pressure. Pakamile was in extreme pain after losing his mother all of a sudden and being locked up in a tiny room without any contact with his loved ones.
After escaping Naledi contacted Bressler. Naledi tells Bressler that Johhny and Zuko were running a counterintelligence operation against Mtima with elite assassins. She says that Malime died due to Mo.The Director of the PIA (Presidential Intelligence Agency), Molebogeng Kwena (Connie Ferguson), found out that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Thandiwe Makeba (Connie Chiume), was also involved with Johnny and his group. The connection between Makeba and Johnny was something Mo was keen on finding out.
She was surprised to learn that Mtima knew about Makeba's involvement, and he also had incriminating evidence against the former minister for her involvement in illegal mining. But even with the evidence against her, Makeba continued to be a threat to Mtima, and Mo was instructed to silence her. She had no choice but to obey Mtima because of her tainted past- her father was closely involved with the apartheid regime. Mo met Makeba to find out about Johnny's plan, but all the former politician disclosed was that Mtima would lose everything he had built by Friday.Thandi believed that it was her duty to protect South Africa from people like Mtima, who would not mind selling the nation for their own benefit. She and Johnny had created a deadly weapon, Zuko, to ensure that the innocent would not suffer from injustice. Thandi hoped for Mo to side with the cause after finding out about their pure intention, but it was all too late for Mo; she was already knee-deep in helping Mtima. Mo struck Thandi with a blunt object, and the former minister bled to death.Zuko felt reconnected with his ancestors when he reached Maseru and met the elders at the village. They tended to his wounds and handed him the letter Johnny had left for him. Zuko was reminded of the cause he was fighting for and how it was greater than everything else. He found the files Johnny had promised, and before releasing them to the public, he burned down the file of Alkebulan.
Just when Zuko accepted his role in the grand scheme of things, Mo informed him how every member of the group had been compromised. Zuko was furious when he found out that Malime met with an accident and Pakamile was kidnapped. He realized that the only way to stop Mtima was by exposing him, and he contacted Mike Bressler to hand over the files Johnny had left. They secretly met at a restaurant, and before handing over the documents, Zuko laid forth a condition: he was desperate to be reunited with his family, and he hoped for Bressler to help him.Bressler helped Zuko connect with Naledi, and it was from her that he found out about Malime's death. Zuko realized that before destroying Mtima, it was important that he get his son back. Naledi had been keeping track of Mo, and she had located a cabin she frequented. Bressler recognized the cabin; it was where Mtima lived when he visited Cape Town. Zuko broke into Mtima's cabin to seek his ultimate revenge.With the spear handed to him by his elders, Zuko slayed Mtima's guards one after the other. Mtima was easy to knock out, and by the time he came back to his senses, Zuko had his spear pressed on Mtima's throat. The presidential hopeful was well aware that Zuko was desperate to get his son back, and he knew that he would not be harmed as long as he had Pakamile. Zuko instructed Mo to get his son back, and in the meantime, Mtima tried to lure Zuko with money.Mtima's PIA agents arrived at the cabin, and what followed was an intense fight where Zuko triumphed. Mo brought along Pakamile to stop Zuko and force him to hand over the files. Zuko explained that he had already handed over the files for printing, and Mtima's political career was over. Mo was holding a gun, and she pointed it at Zuko. Mtima encouraged her to shoot him dead and prove to the world that she was not a traitor like her father. Mo crossed all boundaries, fearing being publicly shamed for her father's association with the apartheid regime, but she realized that as long as Mtima lived, there would never be an end to her misery.Mo shoots Mtima dead. She wanted to kill Zuko as well, but Naledi came to his rescue. Mo was shot dead, and it was all over for Mtima and his supporters.
The next morning, the murders of Daza Mtima and Molebogeng Kwena made it to the headlines. There were officially no suspects, suggesting that Zuko and Naledi had managed to walk away Scot-free. The files Johnny had gathered made it to the public, and those involved in the State capture were apprehended. While some sense of justice was brought into the world, Zuko headed back to his childhood home at the Great Fish River with his son by his side. He wanted to live a life of a recluse and dedicate all his time to farming, just like he and Pakamile had always planned.</p>

                            <p>Description: Oliwia (Anna Szymanczyk) worked as a chef in Wroclaw, and she was doing great in her career. For the last five years, her boss was dependent on her, and he knew that his cafe was so well known because of the exquisite dishes that Oliwia used to make.
One day, Oliwia got a call from her village, situated in the Podlaskie province, and she was informed that her grandmother had passed away. She asked her boss for a leave and rushed to her village immediately, as she knew that she was the only family member her grandmother had.
Oliwia's mother and grandmother used to fight all the time, and as a result, Oliwia never stayed a lot with her grandmother as her mother went off to live on the other side of the world.
Oliwia grew to up be a girl with a hot temper and no patience.Oliwia got the shock of her life when she realized that it was all an act, and her grandmother was pretty much alive. Her grandmother, Halina (Anna Seniuk), had lied to her, saying she wanted Oliwia to come back to the village and stay with her. Oliwia got mad at first, but then she realized that her grandmother missed her way too much. Oliwia's car was broken down (most probably it was messed up by one of the villagers to prompt Oliwia to stay the night).
Halina says that it was Oliwia's mother who turned her against her grandmother.
Still, Oliwia knew that she would go back in a couple of days, but she had no clue about what Halina had in her mind. She went missing just a day before Oliwia's departure, and she left a note for the latter, telling her that she was leaving her farm in her care. The farm had a horse named Dumpling which was bought for Oliwia when it was a colt.Oliwia was stuck, and additionally, she didn't know how to manage an entire farm. Luckily, she met a man who told her that he was Wojtek (Mateusz Janicki), the caretaker who generally provided a helping hand to Halina. Oliwia was glad that she found someone on whom she could put all the responsibilities and leave, but she had no clue that the entire village was conspiring together with Halina.
Oliwia meets her childhood friend Matylda Wasyl (Angelika Cegielska-Swiatek), and they used to go apple picking together. Matylda is with the local police and tells Oliwia that Halina is alive and well and is using the internet at Matylda's house to keep tabs on Oliwia.Eventually, Oliwia starts riding Dumpling and enjoying the farm life. Wojtek even fixes her car. Oliwia bonds with her farm animals when a recently born baby goat got sick and really weak. Oliwia had to feed the baby goat by herself to save her life.
The town had many colorful characters including 2 brothers who brewed their own moonshine. Oliwia suggests them to mix their flavors to create an even more amazing brew.Everybody knew that Halina was hiding in Jan's (Artur Barcis) house, but no one informed Oliwia about it, as they, too, wanted her to stay back with her grandmother. The man who said he was Wojtek was actually the owner of the Herbal World, and his real name was Kuba Wolak. Kuba made sure that Olivia's car didn't start the next day, hoping that it would coerce her to stay back.Although Oliwia was annoyed when her car didn't start, she decided to see the brighter side of things. She knew she had a hectic life in the city, and she realized that it wouldn't be such a bad thing to stay back and take some downtime. Halina was happy that her plan was working, and she wished and hoped that her granddaughter would stay there for good.
Oliwia gets a hang of farm work, including the milking of goats. Matylda comes by and convinces her to take a longer vacation from work. Her boss is distraught but gives her another week.Now, firstly, Kuba had lied about his identity, and secondly, Oliwia got to know that he was an arch-nemesis of her grandmother. Oliwia got to know that, first, Kuba and his father had filed a suit against her grandmother for the damages (to tune of 25,000 Zlotys) caused to their business.
Oliwia's mother had sold their meadow to Kuba's father, and this is what Halina and Oliwia's mother fought about, as the meadow was sold without Halina's consent.
Oliwia realizes that man she thought was Wojtek is really Kuba. She had gone with an offer to sell the entire farm for 150,000 Zoltys, but Kuba tells Oliwia that Halina can earn that money from the farm to pay of her debts.Oliwia realized that maybe Kuba was a monopolist, and he was envious of the fact that Halina's cheese production business was doing so well. Halina won awards every year for her product, and it was said that her cheese was the best in the entire region. This is when the health department had come for inspection at Halina's farm, and after that, they had put a ban on the production of cheese.Halina's cheese was of the best quality, and it felt like either the health inspector had a grudge against her, or somebody had bribed him or used their influence to destroy Halina's business. The suspicion fell on Kuba, as he was the one who had these legal battles going on. Kuba had fallen for Oliwia, and he wanted to tell her that he was not the person she believed him to be. Kuba tried telling Oliwia that it was all a big misunderstanding. He told her that he had not called the health department, and in fact, it was Halina who had filed a complaint against him at first.Kuba had separated from his wife sometime back, and his girl stayed with him. Kuba wanted things to work out between him and Oliwia, and so one day, on the advice of his daughter, he decided to express his feelings to her. Oliwia also liked Kuba, but the fact was that she was never going to stay in the village, and a long-distance relationship was something that she felt was not doable.
Kuba tried to approach Oliwia, but he was stopped by Halina's friends who did not want Oliwia mixing up with Halina's arch-nemesis.
Oliwia restarts making cheese from goat milk, using Halina's recipe. The first batch is only so-so. Kuba's daughter comes by and suggests that Oliwia can improve the taste using herbs from Kuba's herb garden. Oliwia becomes best friends with Kuba's daughter and learns that Kuba is in love with her.Over a period of time, Kuba realized that not only did he have a strong bond with Oliwia on a personal level, but they were also too good when it came to professional partnerships. One time, people from Warsaw were coming to meet Kuba as they saw potential in his herb world initiative, and they wanted to invest money in the new venture that he was going to open in Bialystok. At the last moment, Kuba realized that his father had fired the chef and there was nobody to cook food for them. He asked Oliwia to help him out, and considering she was a professional chef, she made the most delicious lunch for the guests. The Varsovians were impressed, and they decided to invest money in Kuba's venture.When Halina came back from hiding, she got to know that it was a lady named Maryla Jura (Beata Kawka) who had snitched and informed the health department.
Halina accepted Kuba and Oliwia's relationship, as she knew that there was a possibility that because of Kuba, Oliwia might stay back. But Oliwia was a practical girl, and she decided that her life was in the city. She had huge dreams, and so to fulfill them once again, with tears in her eyes, she went back.
Kuba stood there on his farm, watching Oliwia drive her car away. He wanted to stop her; he wanted to tell her how much he needed her in his life, but he knew that he couldn't do that. Kuba knew that their relationship wouldn't be sustainable if he forced her to stay. Kuba wanted her to get the realization, and he was prepared that probably she wouldn't ever return to the village.But something happened to Oliwia once she got back to her city. She felt a void inside her, and she just couldn't focus on anything.
Yes, her career was there, but there was nobody around her whom she could call her own. She craved her grandmother's presence; she longed to be with Kuba, and she felt deprived of that warmth that she got there from everybody else.That's when Oliwia decided to go back to her village. It was a tough decision for her, but she was very clear about her priorities. In the end, Kuba was elated when he found that Oliwia had come back, and he just couldn't stop blushing when he heard the hooves of her horse approaching him. Halina got what she wanted, and probably in the future, Oliwia wouldn't have to compromise on her career, and she would take her grandmother's home-grown business to greater heights.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location.
They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief.
Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken.
Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.
Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.
In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague.
Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along.This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in.
Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves.
The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection.
This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house.
Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her.The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth.
Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief.
So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work.
However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up.
Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal.
Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.
On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.</p>

                            <p>Description: The Royal Delhi Club was full of peculiar characters who, though, moved among the normal people, their lives were nothing like them. The privy purses were abolished in India in 1971, but the people of the club still believed themselves no less than royalty. The fee to join the club is Rs 1 Crores and 99 Lakhs plus GST and a waiting period of 20 years. Even Presidents of the country have played golf there.
A new president was to be elected for the club, and Shehnaz Noorani (Karisma Kapoor), an actress and socialite, and Ranvijay Singh (Sanjay Kapoor), who still asked people to address him as "Hukum," were standing against each other. Devendra Bhatti (Deven Bhojani) is the current president of the club.
Amidst all these pretentious people was a man named Akash Dogra, (Vijay Varma) who told his family that he didn't like going to the club since he was against classicism. Bambi (Sara Ali Khan), whose husband died in a bus crash, also arrived at the gala, and before marriage, she was very close to Akash. For some unknown reason, they couldn't get married, but the spark was still there.
Akash is the son of Brigadier Balbir Dogra (Purnendu Bhattacharya) and Mrs. Mala Dogra (Grusha Kapoor). Cookie Katoch (Dimple Kapadia) is a member and drinks a special beetroot juice that is handmade. Cookie is an artists and makes decorative sculptures for the club.
Guppie is the gardener and has dementia.The dead body of the club fitness trainer, Leo Mathews (Aashim Gulati), was found in the gym. Leo was exercising and apparently while doing bench press, the bar slipped and fell on his neck, killing him. The CCTV of the gym were covered up by balloons at the time of Leo's death between 5 and 7 am.
That's when ACP Bhavani (Pankaj Tripathi) and sub-inspector Padam (Priyank Tiwary) took charge of the matter and started investigating the case. Bhavani concludes that Leo was murdered. The body was discovered when Cookie, Bambi and Roshni went to the gym at 7 am.
Akash is a lawyer and was also representing Leo. The night before the murder, the club hosted Tambola night, and Leo was reading the numbers. Ranvijay got into a fight with Leo when he called Ranvijay "uncle", after he won the full house. Akash came to defend Leo, and he and Ranvijay traded blows with each other.
Next to Leo's body was his protein shake drink which was prepared by gym trainers Thinsuk or Theju. Minu is a waitress at the club and is Theju's girlfriend. Ganga works at the club's beauty parlor and is rumored to be having an affair with Ranvijay, after the death of her husband.
ACP often saw Guppie (Brijendra Kala) excessively watering the beetroot plants, but until the time the former went to have dinner at the Dogras, he didn't know that it was for a reason.They found out that Leo was a sort of Robin Hood who robbed the rich and gave it to the poor. He had a charitable institute called the Shepherd's Home orphanage, and he found ways to coerce the members of the club to donate money there.
Bambi tells Akash that Leo was blackmailing her as he knew that she was a Kleptomaniac. Bhavani searches Leo's room and finds that his tablet is missing on which he used to record his videos.
The autopsy report indicates that Leo was drugged with an opiate prior to his death. The opiate would have turned his bones to rubber, and muscles into jelly. Leo's protein shake had no traces of the opiate, but a spill at the front of gym had some traces where the club cat Prince Harry was found unconscious.Bambi and Akash find out about the opiate connection and learn that the drug supplier to the club used to be Ajay Kumar, Ganga's husband who vanished 3 years ago. They also see Yash, Roshni's son buying drugs, even though he is supposed to be clean post rehab. Bambi breaks into Yash's home and finds evidence that Yash was using the same opiates found in Leo's bloodstream.
Before Bhavani could examine Prince Harry, he was found roasted in Guppie's oven. Guppie believes he put Prince Harry in the oven and caused its death. Bambi speaks to Guppie and consoles him but realizes that Yash was spying on them.
Ranvijay wins the election. That night Guppie was found murdered in his room, and the body was discovered by Yash and Akash.
The ACP, for the longest time, did not understand why such a poor soul was murdered. But then it struck the ACP that Guppie was actually not watering the plants, but in reality, he was trying to melt the bones of the skeleton that lay underneath by sprinkling acid on the soil.Akash finds earnings that he had gifted to Bambi, in the evidence related to Leo's murder. When he confronts Bambi, she claims that she had a physical relationship with Leo, and the earrings were payment to keep his mouth shut.
Akash reports Yash's opiate stock in his house, but Bhavani finds nothing there.The kitchen garden, which was named after Ranvijay Singh's late wife, was dug up, and the skeleton was found. The skeleton had crystal shards inside the eye socket.ACP Bhavani was interrogating every member of the Royal Delhi Club, and he got to know a lot of dirty secrets about them.
He found out that Ranvijay Singh was in a relationship with Thinsuk (a gym trainer as well), and his entire life was a big lie. He had no money, and he rented cars every day from a mechanic to mislead the people into believing that he still lived a life of privileges. In reality, Ranvijay just waited for the time when he could go to the club and feel like he was still the king. Leo was blackmailing Ranvijay because he knew his reality and also about his relationship with Thinsuk, which was why he was forced to donate to the orphanage.
At Ranvijay's house, Bhavani finds a decorative sculpture of Mother Teresa with some crystal shards missing. Cookie recognizes her work and says that she made 2 sculptures, one for Ranvijay and 2nd one to the Dogras.At first, everybody thought that the skeleton would be of Ganga's (Tara Alisha Berry) missing husband, Ajay Kumar (Alok Panwar).
Ajay supplied drugs to a lot of people in the club, and he subjected Ganga to physical abuse a lot of times. But a twist came when Ajay Kumar was caught alive by Padam, and that's when the ACP realized that reality was not how it seemed at first.
After the DNA reports came, ACP Bhavani got to know that the skeleton was of Anshul (Varun Mitra), Bambi's husband, who was believed to have passed away in a bus crash. After the revelation, Akash Dogra became the prime suspect, as everybody knew that he loved Bambi and that he always wanted to marry her.
Akash goes missing after he gets a call from Rakesh that he found Leo's tablet. This is when Yash is found in his bathtub trying to commit suicide, with a suicide note by his side. But Roshni arrives and saves him. Yash goes into a coma.The ACP called everybody to the Royal Delhi Club, as he wanted to expose the murderer in the presence of all the members.Rakesh, the warden of the orphanage, was Shehnaz's son, and Leo knew about that fact. He blackmailed her and told her that he would tell everybody about her reality if she didn't make huge donations.
ACP had come to know about that fact as one day Shehnaz got provoked by something he said, and she told him how she delivered a baby during the 1992 Mumbai riots. ACP Bhavani knew that Shehnaz's two daughters were not so old, and so he speculated that she must have had another child about whom the world didn't know.Yash (Suhail Nayyar) was a drug addict, and his mother, Roshni Batra (Tisca Chopra), knew about that fact but hid it from the world.ACP firstly tried to frame Yash for all three murders. He said that Yash used to secretly record videos of Bambi, and he tried taking his life as he couldn't see her with Akash. But then Roshni lost her temper.
The ACP created yet another theory according to which Akash Dogra was the killer. The ACP said that on the day of Bambi's and Anshul's anniversary, Akash left the party early, but he once again came back late at night. In the footage recovered from Leo's tab, it was evident that Akash's car was parked at the Royal Delhi Club premises, and he was even seen entering the property.
The ACP told Akash and others that the CCTV footage from that night had been deleted, and even the sculpture that was used as the murder weapon was missing from the day when the incident took place. ACP Bhavani arrested Akash, but Bambi stopped him and said that Yash, before trying to take his life, had written a note in which he had confessed to having killed Anshul, Leo, and Guppie.
But the ACP stuck to his narrative and said that, according to him, it was Akash who had written that letter and left it in the bathtub where Yash was lying.Actually, the ACP had figured out who the murderer was, and he was just lying because he wanted the culprit to come forward. He knew that incriminating Yash would enrage his mother, and then framing Akash would make the killer expose her identity. When Akash was being taken to the police station, Bambi asked the ACP to stop.
That's when Bambi confessed that she was the one who had killed her husband, as he was going to leave her for Ganga. She said that Leo had learned from Guppie that Anshul's skeleton had been buried in the kitchen garden, which was why she had to kill him. Then she went on to kill Guppie, as he was the last witness left.
Bambi was a smart woman, and she knew that she needed to frame somebody for the murders so that the accusation did not come against her or Akash. So that's why she went to kill Yash and left that suicide note near his body. But luckily, Yash survived, though he went into a state of coma due to a drug overdose.
Bhavani found from Akash's grandmother that the bust gifted to them by Cookie was returned to Bambi.
Bambi handed herself over to the law enforcement authorities, and finally, she accepted her defeat.Bambi knew that Anshul didn't love her and that he was cheating on her. But still, she called her marriage perfect, as, according to her perspective, love wasn't an essential ingredient for making a marriage work. Bambi said that two people need to be of the same class as they had to be in a society where they had to maintain their reputation. By reputation, she meant that she needed a guy who had equal financial status, if not more, as compared to her. Bambi accepted that the privileged class often stayed in their cocoon, and they were too terrified to go out in the real world. She said that a person like ACP Bhavani would find the club, and whatever happened there, to be quite absurd, but for her, it was a safe haven.Bambi told Anshul that he could do whatever he wanted as long as he pretended in front of the club members that they had a perfect marriage. But Anshul told Bambi that he was in love with Ganga and that he wanted to end their relationship. That's when Bambi got angry, and she hit him with that sculpture.
Bambi loved Akash so much that she confessed to her crimes to save him, but still, she was so worried about her social status and her image in society that she knew she would never marry him. She opened up about the fact that she tried to find Akash in her husband, but Anshul was nothing like him.
ACP Bhavani pitied them, and he was glad that he had the freedom to be himself at all times. In the end, he advised Akash to not take Bambi's case, but looking at him, he knew that his heart wouldn't allow him to do that.</p>

                            <p>Description: The Royal Delhi Club was full of peculiar characters who, though, moved among the normal people, their lives were nothing like them. The privy purses were abolished in India in 1971, but the people of the club still believed themselves no less than royalty. The fee to join the club is Rs 1 Crores and 99 Lakhs plus GST and a waiting period of 20 years. Even Presidents of the country have played golf there.
A new president was to be elected for the club, and Shehnaz Noorani (Karisma Kapoor), an actress and socialite, and Ranvijay Singh (Sanjay Kapoor), who still asked people to address him as "Hukum," were standing against each other. Devendra Bhatti (Deven Bhojani) is the current president of the club.
Amidst all these pretentious people was a man named Akash Dogra, (Vijay Varma) who told his family that he didn't like going to the club since he was against classicism. Bambi (Sara Ali Khan), whose husband died in a bus crash, also arrived at the gala, and before marriage, she was very close to Akash. For some unknown reason, they couldn't get married, but the spark was still there.
Akash is the son of Brigadier Balbir Dogra (Purnendu Bhattacharya) and Mrs. Mala Dogra (Grusha Kapoor). Cookie Katoch (Dimple Kapadia) is a member and drinks a special beetroot juice that is handmade. Cookie is an artists and makes decorative sculptures for the club.
Guppie is the gardener and has dementia.The dead body of the club fitness trainer, Leo Mathews (Aashim Gulati), was found in the gym. Leo was exercising and apparently while doing bench press, the bar slipped and fell on his neck, killing him. The CCTV of the gym were covered up by balloons at the time of Leo's death between 5 and 7 am.
That's when ACP Bhavani (Pankaj Tripathi) and sub-inspector Padam (Priyank Tiwary) took charge of the matter and started investigating the case. Bhavani concludes that Leo was murdered. The body was discovered when Cookie, Bambi and Roshni went to the gym at 7 am.
Akash is a lawyer and was also representing Leo. The night before the murder, the club hosted Tambola night, and Leo was reading the numbers. Ranvijay got into a fight with Leo when he called Ranvijay "uncle", after he won the full house. Akash came to defend Leo, and he and Ranvijay traded blows with each other.
Next to Leo's body was his protein shake drink which was prepared by gym trainers Thinsuk or Theju. Minu is a waitress at the club and is Theju's girlfriend. Ganga works at the club's beauty parlor and is rumored to be having an affair with Ranvijay, after the death of her husband.
ACP often saw Guppie (Brijendra Kala) excessively watering the beetroot plants, but until the time the former went to have dinner at the Dogras, he didn't know that it was for a reason.They found out that Leo was a sort of Robin Hood who robbed the rich and gave it to the poor. He had a charitable institute called the Shepherd's Home orphanage, and he found ways to coerce the members of the club to donate money there.
Bambi tells Akash that Leo was blackmailing her as he knew that she was a Kleptomaniac. Bhavani searches Leo's room and finds that his tablet is missing on which he used to record his videos.
The autopsy report indicates that Leo was drugged with an opiate prior to his death. The opiate would have turned his bones to rubber, and muscles into jelly. Leo's protein shake had no traces of the opiate, but a spill at the front of gym had some traces where the club cat Prince Harry was found unconscious.Bambi and Akash find out about the opiate connection and learn that the drug supplier to the club used to be Ajay Kumar, Ganga's husband who vanished 3 years ago. They also see Yash, Roshni's son buying drugs, even though he is supposed to be clean post rehab. Bambi breaks into Yash's home and finds evidence that Yash was using the same opiates found in Leo's bloodstream.
Before Bhavani could examine Prince Harry, he was found roasted in Guppie's oven. Guppie believes he put Prince Harry in the oven and caused its death. Bambi speaks to Guppie and consoles him but realizes that Yash was spying on them.
Ranvijay wins the election. That night Guppie was found murdered in his room, and the body was discovered by Yash and Akash.
The ACP, for the longest time, did not understand why such a poor soul was murdered. But then it struck the ACP that Guppie was actually not watering the plants, but in reality, he was trying to melt the bones of the skeleton that lay underneath by sprinkling acid on the soil.Akash finds earnings that he had gifted to Bambi, in the evidence related to Leo's murder. When he confronts Bambi, she claims that she had a physical relationship with Leo, and the earrings were payment to keep his mouth shut.
Akash reports Yash's opiate stock in his house, but Bhavani finds nothing there.The kitchen garden, which was named after Ranvijay Singh's late wife, was dug up, and the skeleton was found. The skeleton had crystal shards inside the eye socket.ACP Bhavani was interrogating every member of the Royal Delhi Club, and he got to know a lot of dirty secrets about them.
He found out that Ranvijay Singh was in a relationship with Thinsuk (a gym trainer as well), and his entire life was a big lie. He had no money, and he rented cars every day from a mechanic to mislead the people into believing that he still lived a life of privileges. In reality, Ranvijay just waited for the time when he could go to the club and feel like he was still the king. Leo was blackmailing Ranvijay because he knew his reality and also about his relationship with Thinsuk, which was why he was forced to donate to the orphanage.
At Ranvijay's house, Bhavani finds a decorative sculpture of Mother Teresa with some crystal shards missing. Cookie recognizes her work and says that she made 2 sculptures, one for Ranvijay and 2nd one to the Dogras.At first, everybody thought that the skeleton would be of Ganga's (Tara Alisha Berry) missing husband, Ajay Kumar (Alok Panwar).
Ajay supplied drugs to a lot of people in the club, and he subjected Ganga to physical abuse a lot of times. But a twist came when Ajay Kumar was caught alive by Padam, and that's when the ACP realized that reality was not how it seemed at first.
After the DNA reports came, ACP Bhavani got to know that the skeleton was of Anshul (Varun Mitra), Bambi's husband, who was believed to have passed away in a bus crash. After the revelation, Akash Dogra became the prime suspect, as everybody knew that he loved Bambi and that he always wanted to marry her.
Akash goes missing after he gets a call from Rakesh that he found Leo's tablet. This is when Yash is found in his bathtub trying to commit suicide, with a suicide note by his side. But Roshni arrives and saves him. Yash goes into a coma.The ACP called everybody to the Royal Delhi Club, as he wanted to expose the murderer in the presence of all the members.Rakesh, the warden of the orphanage, was Shehnaz's son, and Leo knew about that fact. He blackmailed her and told her that he would tell everybody about her reality if she didn't make huge donations.
ACP had come to know about that fact as one day Shehnaz got provoked by something he said, and she told him how she delivered a baby during the 1992 Mumbai riots. ACP Bhavani knew that Shehnaz's two daughters were not so old, and so he speculated that she must have had another child about whom the world didn't know.Yash (Suhail Nayyar) was a drug addict, and his mother, Roshni Batra (Tisca Chopra), knew about that fact but hid it from the world.ACP firstly tried to frame Yash for all three murders. He said that Yash used to secretly record videos of Bambi, and he tried taking his life as he couldn't see her with Akash. But then Roshni lost her temper.
The ACP created yet another theory according to which Akash Dogra was the killer. The ACP said that on the day of Bambi's and Anshul's anniversary, Akash left the party early, but he once again came back late at night. In the footage recovered from Leo's tab, it was evident that Akash's car was parked at the Royal Delhi Club premises, and he was even seen entering the property.
The ACP told Akash and others that the CCTV footage from that night had been deleted, and even the sculpture that was used as the murder weapon was missing from the day when the incident took place. ACP Bhavani arrested Akash, but Bambi stopped him and said that Yash, before trying to take his life, had written a note in which he had confessed to having killed Anshul, Leo, and Guppie.
But the ACP stuck to his narrative and said that, according to him, it was Akash who had written that letter and left it in the bathtub where Yash was lying.Actually, the ACP had figured out who the murderer was, and he was just lying because he wanted the culprit to come forward. He knew that incriminating Yash would enrage his mother, and then framing Akash would make the killer expose her identity. When Akash was being taken to the police station, Bambi asked the ACP to stop.
That's when Bambi confessed that she was the one who had killed her husband, as he was going to leave her for Ganga. She said that Leo had learned from Guppie that Anshul's skeleton had been buried in the kitchen garden, which was why she had to kill him. Then she went on to kill Guppie, as he was the last witness left.
Bambi was a smart woman, and she knew that she needed to frame somebody for the murders so that the accusation did not come against her or Akash. So that's why she went to kill Yash and left that suicide note near his body. But luckily, Yash survived, though he went into a state of coma due to a drug overdose.
Bhavani found from Akash's grandmother that the bust gifted to them by Cookie was returned to Bambi.
Bambi handed herself over to the law enforcement authorities, and finally, she accepted her defeat.Bambi knew that Anshul didn't love her and that he was cheating on her. But still, she called her marriage perfect, as, according to her perspective, love wasn't an essential ingredient for making a marriage work. Bambi said that two people need to be of the same class as they had to be in a society where they had to maintain their reputation. By reputation, she meant that she needed a guy who had equal financial status, if not more, as compared to her. Bambi accepted that the privileged class often stayed in their cocoon, and they were too terrified to go out in the real world. She said that a person like ACP Bhavani would find the club, and whatever happened there, to be quite absurd, but for her, it was a safe haven.Bambi told Anshul that he could do whatever he wanted as long as he pretended in front of the club members that they had a perfect marriage. But Anshul told Bambi that he was in love with Ganga and that he wanted to end their relationship. That's when Bambi got angry, and she hit him with that sculpture.
Bambi loved Akash so much that she confessed to her crimes to save him, but still, she was so worried about her social status and her image in society that she knew she would never marry him. She opened up about the fact that she tried to find Akash in her husband, but Anshul was nothing like him.
ACP Bhavani pitied them, and he was glad that he had the freedom to be himself at all times. In the end, he advised Akash to not take Bambi's case, but looking at him, he knew that his heart wouldn't allow him to do that.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location.
They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief.
Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken.
Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.
Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.
In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague.
Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along.This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in.
Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves.
The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection.
This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house.
Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her.The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth.
Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief.
So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work.
However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up.
Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal.
Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.
On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.</p>

                            <p>Description: In-between jobs, New York City fashion psychologist Lauren Elliott accepts short term work for her best friend Charlotte Gauthier's new boss, neurotic and high strung Virgil St-James, the successful head designer at Lavigne, a Paris fashion house, in the lead up to the debut of Virgil's latest collection at Paris Fashion Week. Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

                            <p>Description: Children's book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Alice enjoys Jessica but Taylor keeps her at arms length. Jessica is plagued by nightmares which include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear in the basement named Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor named Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, reunites with her. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember.Alice and Taylor's mentally disturbed biological mother Samantha sneaks into the house to see her daughters and attacks Jessica. When the police arrive to arrest Samantha, Taylor confesses to texting her. Jessica then puts Alice and Chauncey to bed, and remarks that she had a similar childhood friend.Max leaves to embark on tour and Alice becomes hyper-focused on a scavenger hunt she claims was given to her by Chauncey. Chauncey's overwhelming presence in Alice's life begins to disturb Jessica. One day when Jessica leaves to visit Ben, Taylor invites an acquaintance over, Liam. Liam grabs a bottle of liquor which he accidentally shatters. He attempts to find a towel before being toyed with by Chauncey, who briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica arrives back home, angering Taylor.Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail prompting her to call a child psychologist named Dr. Soto. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey while also speaking on his behalf. Chauncey makes threatening remarks towards Jessica and Alice sobs over their crumbling friendship. Jessica later discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto then shows Jessica footage of a past patient who uses the same phrase as Alice: "Never Ever". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey which Taylor blames her stepmother for.Taylor meets Gloria, who tells her that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains to Taylor that imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned, which Jessica did with Chauncey. At home, Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and of the Never Ever. All three women complete the scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm to appear.In the Never Ever realm, the group find a door showing Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, Jessica was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but he became mad in the process after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Afterwards, Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm throughout her life. Gloria is savagely mauled by Chauncey when a door opens beside her. Jessica and Taylor rush off, searching for Alice. Both find Alice and attempt to escape while Chauncey pursues behind them. Jessica is able to stop Chauncey by stabbing him in the eye with scissors.After reuniting with Ben and Max at Ben's institution, Jessica realizes she is still stuck in the Never Ever. Chauncey used Alice as bait to get to Jessica and seeks revenge for her prior abandonment. Taylor arrives and saves Jessica. Chauncey turns to his true form akin to Simon. The spider tries to turn Jessica and Taylor insane with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire and seals him behind the door. The family escapes as the house burns to the ground.The family check into a hotel but are frightened by a child playing with his teddy bear who resembles Chauncey. The three leave to another hotel for their safety.</p>

                            <p>Description: Set in the northern snowy landscapes of Sweden, Sami family prepares their young daughter for her earmark ceremony, which is an important tradition in their culture. The young girl, Elsa (Elin Kristina Oskal), is equally excited and scared of what she has to do, as she wants to feel one with her people but also does not want to hurt any of their animals.
As her father shows her the many calves she can choose from, Elsa picks up a beautiful baby reindeer with white fur and a mark on its head. She lovingly names it Nastegallu. In the weeks following the ceremony, Elsa and Nastegallu grow very close to each other, as the animal shows all signs of love and submission to her. Despite her father's warnings, little Elsa also showers the reindeer with grass and other treats. Elsa is a natural reindeer herder.
Lasse (Pvva Pittja) is Elsa's brother and Nils-Johan (Magnus Kuhmunen) is her father.But the occupation has been growing increasingly tough for the Sami people because people of other ethnicity and cultures living in the nearby areas do not respect the animals at all. In fact, a group of hunters has been killing the reindeer. Tragedy strikes for Elsa when she suddenly sees a man kill Nastegallu with a knife attack at the reindeer grazing grounds, but she has to hide in fear. The killer sees Elsa and threatens to kill her, too, if she ever speaks up about it.
By the time the girl's father, uncle, and brother reach the scene, it is too late to catch the killer. The next day, Elsa's father takes her to the nearest police station to file a complaint against the perpetrator, and incidentally, she sees the same man at the place, having a friendly chat with the officers. Shocked and scared for her own safety, Elsa does not say anything about seeing the killer in action to the police officer . The police officially report Nastegallu as having been stolen, as they refuse to accept charges of slaughter.Ten years pass by, and Elsa is now a young adult, having taken on the role of a teacher at the local school. She is as loving and protective of her culture and identity as a Sami woman, and so she is still threatened by the constant butchering of reindeer, which is still not investigated or punished. To this day, Elsa regrets not speaking up about the perpetrator despite having recognized him as their neighbor, Robert Isaksson (Martin Wallstrom). As the woman intends to somehow punish the man for his crimes, more troubling situations are posed against the Sami people.
Niila (Niila Emanuel Omma) is the son of the Reindeer King and is interested in Elsa.Sami people are entirely dependent on the herds of reindeer that they own, as their whole life is driven by the animals. As they rear the animals for skin, fur, and meat and also rely on these products as a means of trade, the indigenous people would be very clueless without the existence of the reindeer. Moreover, the practice of herding reindeer and the associated activities with it are all part of the Sami's culture, which is severely endangered at this point in time. Due to climate changes and deforestation, it is increasingly difficult to sustain the herds. Lasse even took up a job at the mines in town of Kiruna.For people of other cultures living in the nearby regions, the reindeer is nothing more than a hassle, for they are forced to shape their lives according to the animals' needs. Because of the close connection between the creatures and the Sami people, which are officially declared endangered, the government has also made certain rules to help both sets survive better. As a result, the others in the area have to abide by laws, such as not being able to use snowmobiles during certain seasons and having to stay clear of the paths used by the reindeer during their migration from summer to winter pastures. With no concern for the animals or the Sami people, the likes of Robert Isaksson keep harping about how their lives are being affected by the animals and the rules surrounding their conservation in an attempt to get rid of them.As a result, the feeling of xenophobia is greatly on the rise among these communities, as they genuinely disrespect the Sami people, their culture, and their way of life. To make matters worse, most of the officials in the police and administration, if not all, are Swedish or Caucasians, meaning that they, too, are not bothered by the killings of the reindeer and the overall discrimination that the Sami face.Robert Isaksson takes the most daring and vile step of killing the reindeer in order to both run a business and also disrespect the Sami in the region. Robert runs an illegal reindeer hunting and meat trade, because of which he shoots down and kills numerous animals, but he is also not like any usual hunter. The man is boastful and brash with his killings, sometimes torturing and teasing the animals, even injuring and killing one with his snowmobile in one instance. He is egoistic as well, which leads to extreme anger and frustration in him often, especially with regards to the Sami people having a say in how things in the region should operate. Robert and his men kill multiple animals and make a crude altar out of the dead bodies, mocking the Sami people and their way of life. They also put the reindeer fodder on fire, destroying expensive supplies while even making a video of it and ridiculing the owners.One day Elsa followed the snowmobile tracks after she heard shots. And she reached a shed that belonged to Robert. Else calls the police, but they don't have a warrant to enter Robert's property. Robert claims that the Sami tribes are killing their own reindeer and claiming theft compensation from the Government.Along with the external problems that the group has to face, Elsa is also bitter and disgruntled with the reactions of the very people in her tribe, as they are too soft and ineffective in protecting their rights. The elected leader of the Sami in the region, Olle (Simon Issat Marainen), is clearly not stern enough in his negotiations, and he is also rather sexist, as he does not want a woman, especially a young one like Elsa, to be so vocal about their problems. Elsa is understandably frustrated by this situation, and she even seriously considers leaving the village to pursue higher education as she starts to feel that there is no way forward for her people.The village council soon has a meeting with representatives of all the families living in the area as the matter of a mining business being opened is discussed. The Sami people naturally object to it, as the existence of a large mine in the middle of the route used by their reindeer would cause trouble for the animals. Moreover, the mine would also pollute the water and air, along with the land, which would very quickly give rise to other environmental degradation. However, the others in the area complain that their benefits should also be considered at times. With laws against hunting and fishing, the mine would be the only major opportunity for employment in the village, which is highly required for the livelihood of these people. In this meeting, Elsa's frustration boils over, and she directly addresses the committee, speaking about the importance of the reindeer for her people.
Lasse is depressed at working over in the mines and commits suicide. On the day of his funeral, Elsa runs into Robert and warns him to stop killing the reindeer.
Later that day, the family attends a traditional Sami fair, and Elsa has sex with Niila.A false narrative, that the Sami people themselves kill their reindeer in order to get government compensation, is being floated around, and Elsa is terribly angered by it. She decides to speak out and give a whole interview to one of the news channels, which is published in the next day's newspaper. This further shocks Olle, and he finally bars Elsa from attending meetings.Elsa starts to speak up against the vile nature of Robert and his followers and even regularly reports the killings to the police, Isaksson is furious and wants his revenge. Sometime later, when Robert Isaksson kills multiple reindeer and makes a mocking altar out of their skulls by the side of the highway, news TV channels from the nearby towns report on the incident.
One day Elsa and Niila finds Robert driving a snowmobile through their protected reindeer pastures. Niila confronts Robert, but is assaulted by Robert with Niila's own gun.In a drunken state, he goes over to Elsa's house to threaten her. He breaks into the house on the very night that Elsa's parents are away, and her brother is drunk. He chases her down only because he did not like her tone when she had threatened him the previous day. It is only because Elsa cleverly manages to hide in the basement and also inform the police about the intruder in her house that she survives the night.Elsa sneaks into Robert's warehouse and photographs everything she sees inside it as proof of the illegal meat trade that was going on. Robert had security cameras installed all over the place, and as soon as he monitors an intrusion on his property, he returns to the place. A tense chase follows, with Robert surely intending to kill Elsa if he can get his hands on her.However, the whole situation changes as Robert loses control of his snowmobile and lands on top of a defrosting water body. The heavy weight and impact of the crash make the ice break, and the man falls into the freezing cold water. With his leg already injured by the crash, Robert is unable to swim up and immediately drowns and dies.Despite her anger against the man, Elsa had finally decided to help him, even throwing a rope towards him, but she was unable to save him. A police investigation into the matter soon led to the arrest of other men who had been part of the meat trade.Else moves on with her life and teaches her culture to other members of the tribe, including the process of cutting off the reindeer's ear tip, suggesting that she continues to spread her culture through generations after having protected her people from the vile Robert Isaksson.</p>

                            <p>Description: 1995: In order to make the building of a new arena an economically viable project, the Denver Nuggets owners bought the NHL Quebec Nordiques and relocated the team in Denver. Two years later, despite the newly-named Colorado Avalanche having won the Stanley Cup in 1996, the team was still losing $8 million per year. Smelling blood in the water, the New York Rangers signed the Avalanche's captain and star player Joe Sakic as a free agent. To keep Sakic, the Avanlache had seven days to match the Rangers' deal and offer Sakic a $15 million signing bonus, payable upfront. As the Avalanche struggled to find the money, an unlikely Harrison Ford stepped in to save the day in a way only Hollywood could.—Chadouf4</p>

                            <p>Description: Overly regimented and risk-averse San Francisco-based Madeline Zekko is planning her and her fiancé Jason Reid's honeymoon to Niagara Falls to take place in five weeks time, Madeline not leaving a second free in the itinerary in wanting to recreate her grandparents' love story there. Instead, Jason, who wants some spontaneity in life and accusing Madeline of not having a spontaneous bone in her body, breaks up with her. Madeline's divorced sister Harley is ultimately able to convince Madeline to take that pre-paid, non-refundable honeymoon trip with her to show Jason that she can indeed be spontaneous. When Madeline and Harley arrive at the tour company's office on their second day in Niagara Falls, Madeline is dismayed to see that their tour guide for the week Mike Hollis, the man with who she had a less than pleasant encounter the day before. With Mike's boss and best friend Emily Henley unable to take over Madeline's tours in working on her own tours for her brother Keegan's best friend Phil and his fiancée Beth who will be getting married at the end of the week, Emily is able to convince both Madeline and Mike to give going on the tours together a try. Mike is further able to convince Madeline to change the itinerary somewhat to incorporate adventure activities, Mike's preferred ones as opposed to the plethora of romance tours that are their bread and butter, again to demonstrate to Jason that she is not totally stuck in her box. In the process with Mike opening up about his two year heartache in who he thought was the one leaving him, Madeline and Mike see a different side of the other as they start to fall for each other, Phil and Beth who end up being a sounding board in being able to provide some insight into why their relationship works. A kink in Madeline opening herself up fully to Mike is Jason, for who she went through the motions of this faux honeymoon.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Girls from a shelter home in Munawwarpur are pimped out, and if something goes wrong, they are killed and cremated. The shelter home is run by Bansi, and his assistant is Sonu, who takes care of the operational details.When Vaishali (Bhumi Pednekar) was handed the social audit report by her informer, she thought it was useless material. She did not believe she had the power to stop the abuse that the girls at the shelter home in Munawwarpur were subjected to. Guptaji (Durgesh Kumar) was quite persistent about the case, and Vaishali took an interest when he mentioned that the police had not taken any action even though it had been two months since the report had been published. Vaishali started to investigate the case. Vaishali needs a strong story to keep her channel alive, else she will lose all viewers, and with it all sources of income.As soon as Vaishali started investigating, Bansi Sahu's (Aditya Srivastava) name cropped up too often. She meets Mithilesh Sinha, the head of Child Welfare Commission who says that he has no such information about the audit.
Sahu, a journalist himself, had a huge influence in the village of Munawwarpur. He contacted Vaishali's husband, Arvind (Surya Sharma), the minute he figured out that a journalist was inquiring about the shelter home. He indirectly threatened Vaishali to back off, but it instead intrigued her interest all the more.
Vaishali soon learned that Bansi Sahu had the support of the government. He bought printing papers at a subsidized rate but barely printed three copies. It was a daylight scam, and no one dared to question him. The shelter home belonged to him, and he was also associated with various other NGOs.
All the shelter homes of the state come under the purview of Ministry of Social Welfare, headed by Rajni Singh.
Everyone was afraid of Bansi Sahu, and the Chief Minister Jitesh Kumar (Anand Sharma) was also within his reach. Vaishali's mentor and cameraman, Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra), was a little shaken upon realizing that they would be challenging the government if they decided to expose the abuse and sex racket. Vaishali decided to continue with her investigation and find evidence that would support the claims made in the report.It was almost impossible to find anyone who could provide information about the Munawwarpur shelter home. They tried their best to track down anyone who had been relocated from the Munawwarpur shelter, but they remained unsuccessful. After inquiring at several shelter homes, they finally found hope at one where the cook previously worked at the Munawwarpur shelter home. When Vaishali and Bhaskar introduced themselves, Sudha (Tanisha Mehta) refused to utter a word. She denied knowing or seeing anything unlawful during her time there. Vaishali gave up and was about to leave when Sudha decided to confess the truth under one condition: she was not ready to go on record, and she did not want her name associated with the case.Sudha spoke about her haunting memories at the shelter home. She brought up Baby Rani (Gulista Alija), the shelter warden, and how she mistreated the girls. She used to force the girls to sleep naked while she assaulted them. The 40-45 girls at the shelter had only one room to sleep in, and their health condition was extremely poor.
One of the girls advised Sudha to run for her life, and she soon figured out the reason behind it. They had a doctor who took care of cases where the victims were injured to an extreme degree. Later, Sudha watched Bansi and his men party (including Mithilesh) at the shelter home, and they abused and tortured the girls at random. She realized she, too, would meet the same fate and decided to run away that very night. Before leaving, she heard Baby Rani and Sonu (Satyakam Anand) mention killing a girl they had pimped out.
The details left Vaishali and Bhaskar speechless. They were all the more determined to expose the perpetrators and rescue the victims. The only problem was that the only witness Vaishali had was not willing to come forward. She soon realized that even though there was a lack of evidence, she had to act confidently to force the abusers to react, and that would eventually lead to one blunder or another.When Vaishali learned that a PIL had been filed against the Munawwarpur shelter home, she assumed her brother-in-law, lawyer Suresh Singh (Danish Iqbal), was behind it. Suresh was completely against Vaishali's decision to look into Bansi Sahu's business. He always looked down upon the work she did, especially because she did not fit into the typical idea of a 'good Indian housewife.' Bansi's men also thought that Suresh was responsible for the PIL, and they roughed him up to teach Vaishali a lesson. Surprisingly, Arvind showed confidence in the work Vaishali had undertaken, and now that she had his support, it was impossible to deter her from exposing the criminals.Vaishali decided to constantly update her audience about the case, and she discussed the torture Suresh was subjected to and how the police refused to file an FIR against Bansi Sahu. Vaishali's small endeavor all of a sudden caught the attention of the common people as well as the influential. She approached the first female SSP of Munawwarpur, Jasmeet Gaur (Sai Tamhankar), to seek help. While Jasmeet was hopeful that she would find a solution, her senior advised her to stay out of it because of the lack of evidence in the case. The next time Jasmeet and Vaishali met, she helped her understand the importance of putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department. Only after Social Welfare Department files in FIR, can the Police do anything.
Meanwhile, it is revealed that it was Guptaji who filed the PIL in Patna High Court.Brijmohan Singh's (Pravin Kumar Sisodia) wife, Rajni Singh (Vibha Chibbar), headed the Social Welfare Department, but he was the one who made all decisions on her behalf. Brijmohan was one of Bansi's many clients, and they maintained a close relationship.
Vaishali realized that the only way she could put pressure on the Social Welfare Department was with believable lies. Bhaskar Sinha was assigned the task of pretending to be a well-wisher of Brijmohan. He managed to meet the politician and warned him of the evidence Vaishali had gathered against him and his wife. To instigate a misunderstanding between Bansi and his men, Bhaskar mentioned that Mithilesh Sinha (Chittaranjan Tripathy) from CWC was responsible for providing information to Vaishali.
Later that night, Vaishali discussed on her show the death of an officer from the Sitamarhi Social Welfare Department, and she believed that he was shot dead because he was putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department to look into the Munawwarpur shelter home case. With a white sheet in her hand, Vaishali claimed that she had every bit of information on how the Munawwarpur shelter home for girls operated. She stated that the next day, she would finally expose all the ministers and well-known personalities involved in the racket on her special program, Bhakshak.After the program was aired, the Chief Minister contacted Rajni Singh and instructed her to file an FIR immediately. Vaishali was hopeful that Jaspreet Gaur would be able to take the case forward from henceforth, but as it turned out, the FIR was filed in the woman's police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act. The Child Welfare Association would record the testimonies of the victim, and if they found anything worth investigating, action would be taken. Vaishali knew there was no hope because Bansi's close aide, Mithilesh Sinha, also a sexual predator, headed the Child Welfare Association. After speaking to the SSP, Vaishali realized that the only way to get the culprits behind bars was by gathering evidence.Vaishali decides to meet Sudha once again and convince her to come forward with her story. Sudha was not ready to endanger her life by becoming a witness in the case, but Vaishali helped her realize how she alone could save the lives of all the abused children. Sudha finally agreed to have her statement recorded. She stood before the camera with her face covered and narrated her entire experience.
Bansi and his associates realized it was the end of their free will. Bansi was an egoistic man, and he did not feel an ounce of shame for the heinous crime he committed. He did not allow Baby Rani and Sonu to throw away the bottles of alcohol and contraceptives stored at the shelter home. He was proud of himself, and he did not try to conceal the crime. Mithilesh walked away from Bansi, fearing losing his job. The next morning, police arrived at the Munawwarpur shelter home and rescued the girls. Bansi and his associates were arrested, and justice was finally served.Vaishali Singh addresses her audience, discussing how often the media fails to address issues of importance because of influence. At times, such cases are overlooked simply because they do not appeal to the audience as much as entertaining news does. She expresses her disappointment with the way the world functions, where there is a clear lack of emotion and sympathy, and people prefer to ignore rather than feel. Vaishali continues to play her part as a journalist, but she questions her audience, asking them if they are doing enough to be called human beings in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: Towards the close of 2012, amidst the widespread speculation about an impending apocalypse, Antares de la Luz, the charismatic leader of a sect in Chile, adeptly manipulates his followers into unwavering obedience under the guise of salvation. This manipulation precipitates a descent into a chilling spiral of terror, culminating in the commission of one of the most heinous crimes in the annals of the nation's history. Through the lens of this Netflix documentary, individuals who were once under his sway recount their experiences, shedding light on how he insidiously usurped their autonomy, subjugating their wills and lives to the extent of distorting their consciences and reason.—Fabula</p>

                            <p>Description: For generations, bumblebees have roamed the earth, tirelessly pollinating our crops and wildflowers, and contributing to the biodiversity of our ecosystems. But with the changing climate and other threats, the survival of these beloved pollinators has been put in jeopardy. "Franklin's Bumblebee," a once-common species, is now critically endangered, with the last sighting dating back to 2006. Today, a group of scientists and explorers embark on a week-long mission every July to search for this elusive bumblebee, hoping to find it before it's too late. This documentary follows the journey of over 50 dedicated individuals as they search for Franklin's Bumblebee and discuss the four major threats to bumblebee populations worldwide: access to food, habitat loss, pesticide use, and disease. Through stunning cinematography and insightful interviews, we explore the vital role of bumblebees in our ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these important pollinators. Join us on this journey to uncover the fate of Franklin's Bumblebee and learn how we can help protect bumblebees and preserve the natural world we all share.—Janice Overbeck</p>

                            <p>Description: Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's (Jennifer Lopez) opinions on love and romance. Alida and Taroo tried to hide their love, but Alida's father found out. She was ordered to marry another from her own tribe. She prayed to the Gods to be rescued, who turn her into a red flower. Taroo begged the Gods to help him find Alida, and they turned him into a hummingbird.Artist reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover (Ben Affleck). Artist always wanted to be in love. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured. With the help of factory workers (the cells within her own body), she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide, but to no avail ("Hearts and Flowers").Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist (Fat Joe). He finds her dreams to be eccentric, which she blames on the conflicting astrological signs between him and his wife.The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra (Gilbert Saldivar); she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being ("Rebound").
Artists friends are The Cynic, The Idealist (Ashley Versher), The Realist (Malcolm Kelner), The Lover (Brandon Delsid), The Quiet One (Alix Angelis) and The Fighter (Danielle Larracuente).She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs (Aries (Jay Shetty), Taurus (Neil DeGrasse Tyson), Gemini (Jenifer Lewis), Cancer (Sofía Vergara), Leo (Post Malone), Virgo (Kim Petras), Libra (Trevor Noah), Scorpio (Keke Palmer), Sagittarius (Jane Fonda), Pisces (Sadhguru)), questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions.
Before they could piece together an answer, Artist enters three unsuccessful marriages with a Pisces (Tony Bellissimo), a Virgo (Derek Hough), and a Cancer (Trevor Jackson), respectively ("Can't Get Enough").The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance.
While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention. They believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices.
In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. Artist says that she believes in true love and that good things happen to good people.
Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story ("Broken Like Me"). Artist admits that she fears that she might be the reason behind her broken relationships.Artist returns home and burns old love letters and childhood memories while a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window.
As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike/The Cynic (Matthew Law), a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her.During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored ("This Is Me... Now"). Artist proves to herself that she only needs to love herself for her to be complete. The power of her conviction releases an energy that shoots off into the Universe and hits a bell at the Zodiacal council.With a new lease on life, Artist attends Mike's wedding alone and encounters several hummingbirds that lead her to her true love ("Midnight Trip to Vegas", "Hummingbird").</p>

                            <p>Description: Lou (Kristen Stewart) works at a hard-core gym, unclogging toilets and being pressured by Daisy (Anna Baryshnikov) for a date.Jackie (Katy O'Brian) arrives in town and has sex with JJ (Dave Franco) in order to secure a job at a gun range. She has nowhere to stay, so she sleeps and works out underneath a nearby bridge.Lou visits her sister, Beth (Jena Malone), whose house is filled with children and suffers clear signs of domestic abuse from her husband, JJ. He leaves for work where he shows Jackie around and introduces her to the owner (Ed Harris).Jackie comes to work out at the gym, and Lou is immediately smitten by her. Her fantasies are interrupted by two FBI agents asking about her father, who she says she hasn't talked to in years. Lou and Jackie chat outside, but are interrupted by two patrons asking Jackie out on a date. She refuses, then punches one in the face after he attempts to grab her. He hits her back and Lou rushes her inside. They talk about Jackie's dream to go to Vegas to compete in the finals for a bodybuilding competition, so Lou offers her a stash of steroids from her office. While Jackie is initially reluctant, she agrees and Lou injects her with a vial. The two are clearly attracted to each other and begin making out, then leave for Lou's apartment to have sex.The following morning, Lou laments that Jackie's working at the gun range, as her estranged dad, Lou Sr., owns it. Lou agrees to let Jackie stay with her, leading to a period of love, sex, and steroid injections. Back at the gun range, Lou Sr. runs a criminal operation smuggling guns to Mexico and teaches Jackie how to shoot a gun.Lou and Jackie go on an awkward double date with JJ and Beth, who has another set of bruises and cuts. Lou follows JJ to the bathroom to threaten him, but he reveals that he slept with Jackie and suggests that she's probably just using Lou for the gym and housing. They fight on the way home, but speed away together after Lou spots the FBI agents.The following day, Lou gets a call that Beth is in the hospital with severe face and head injuries. Lou is furious, but the police will not arrest JJ unless Beth agrees to press charges, which she always refuses to do. Upon seeing Lou sobbing, Jackie's muscles begin to swell and she flies into a rage and drives to Beth's house to violently murder JJ. Lou spots her truck in front of Beth's house and enters to find JJ's body and a catatonic Jackie. After being initially horrified, Lou sets to work cleaning up the mess and puts JJ in the back of his own car. On the way to dispose of the body, Daisy spots Lou and knocks on the window of JJ's car to chat. The girls push the car into a large gorge, then set it on fire, sending smoke billowing into the sky. Lou assures Jackie that there are other things in the gorge that will point the police to someone else, so all they need to do is stay put in the apt. While Lou cleans up Beth's house, Jackie takes many vials of steroids and breaks out of the house to go work out, which infuriates Lou. Still hyped up on steroids, Jackie headbutts Lou and hitchhikes to Vegas for the bodybuilding competition. While her individual performance originally goes well, she has a panic attack and vomits on the stage. When she sees other competitors laughing at her, she viciously attacks them and is arrested.Lou Sr. confronts Lou at the hospital about leading police to the gorge, as it has attracted attention to the bodies that he has dumped down there. When Lou arrives home, she runs into Daisy who begins asking questions about why she was driving JJ's car that night. In order to silence her, Lou has sex with Daisy, who then answers the phone when Jackie calls from jail and tells her not to bother them. Instead, Lou Sr. bails Jackie out of prison and claims he can help her get out of this mess. Lou has continued seeing Daisy to find out what she knows, but when they return to Lou's house, Jackie shoots Daisy in the face, then runs. Lou hides the body behind the couch when FBI agents arrive to continue asking questions about JJ, who was one of their biggest informants on Lou Sr. They reveal they know that Lou used to be Lou Sr.'s right-hand man, so she'd have enough information to put him away. Once they leave, Lou Sr. calls to tell Lou that he has Jackie and plans to pin the double homicide on her. Lou threatens to reveal everything to the FBI if he does that, so he sends over a corrupt policeman to kill her. She knocks him out, then goes to rescue Jackie, but runs into Beth who attacks her for killing JJ. Jackie is tied up in the garage, and after initially running from Lou, they embrace and make up. Lou sends Jackie off towards the car, while she goes to confront her dad, but he arrives and shoots Lou in the leg and prepares to kill her. Jackie, empowered by her love for Lou, appears as a 60ft. woman and pins Lou Sr. to the ground. Lou puts a gun in his mouth, but decides to leave him for the incoming police. The two girls drive into the desert, but Lou hears thumping from the bed of the truck and discovers that Daisy is still alive. As Jackie sleeps, Lou strangles Daisy and drags her body into the desert.</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are excited about the fun nature of their latest catering gig, a by invitation only medieval ball and dinner at Sir Alistair Harrows' home, Hyde Castle, it a fundraiser for Elk Park Prep Academy, the school that Olive attends, she who will be part of a fencing demonstration at the gala. A stickler for authenticity as his home is one big medieval castle without the latest technology such as computers, Internet or cell phones, Sir Alistair dictates to his butler Klaus that all the guests must be dressed in medieval costume, and only invited guests are to be allowed in. Among the guests are many from the Elk Park Police Department, including Tom, Mason and Dave. One uninvited person who is able to make his way in, just before a storm snows them all in, is US Marshal Gerard Trach, Dave's father, who has come to see Tom to question him about his convict father Edmund Schultz as he has escaped from prison, odd in that he would soon be eligible for parole after twenty-five years served for murder. Tom knows nothing about Edmund's whereabouts as he has not spoken to his father since he went to prison, with this news dampening his spirit just before he and Goldy are to go on a big date. Something else that dampens the entire evening is a murder, the victim who was just about to make a self-described earth-shattering announcement. Tom leads the investigation, with Mason and Dave providing official assistance, Gerard somewhat unofficial assistance, and Goldy her inherent sleuthing skills. Even if they don't know the nature of the victim's announcement, they discover that there are many possible suspects as the victim had many enemies among the guests who can't leave even if they wanted to because of the snow. But what Tom probably did not expect is that his father would factor into the proceedings.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Girls from a shelter home in Munawwarpur are pimped out, and if something goes wrong, they are killed and cremated. The shelter home is run by Bansi, and his assistant is Sonu, who takes care of the operational details.When Vaishali (Bhumi Pednekar) was handed the social audit report by her informer, she thought it was useless material. She did not believe she had the power to stop the abuse that the girls at the shelter home in Munawwarpur were subjected to. Guptaji (Durgesh Kumar) was quite persistent about the case, and Vaishali took an interest when he mentioned that the police had not taken any action even though it had been two months since the report had been published. Vaishali started to investigate the case. Vaishali needs a strong story to keep her channel alive, else she will lose all viewers, and with it all sources of income.As soon as Vaishali started investigating, Bansi Sahu's (Aditya Srivastava) name cropped up too often. She meets Mithilesh Sinha, the head of Child Welfare Commission who says that he has no such information about the audit.
Sahu, a journalist himself, had a huge influence in the village of Munawwarpur. He contacted Vaishali's husband, Arvind (Surya Sharma), the minute he figured out that a journalist was inquiring about the shelter home. He indirectly threatened Vaishali to back off, but it instead intrigued her interest all the more.
Vaishali soon learned that Bansi Sahu had the support of the government. He bought printing papers at a subsidized rate but barely printed three copies. It was a daylight scam, and no one dared to question him. The shelter home belonged to him, and he was also associated with various other NGOs.
All the shelter homes of the state come under the purview of Ministry of Social Welfare, headed by Rajni Singh.
Everyone was afraid of Bansi Sahu, and the Chief Minister Jitesh Kumar (Anand Sharma) was also within his reach. Vaishali's mentor and cameraman, Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra), was a little shaken upon realizing that they would be challenging the government if they decided to expose the abuse and sex racket. Vaishali decided to continue with her investigation and find evidence that would support the claims made in the report.It was almost impossible to find anyone who could provide information about the Munawwarpur shelter home. They tried their best to track down anyone who had been relocated from the Munawwarpur shelter, but they remained unsuccessful. After inquiring at several shelter homes, they finally found hope at one where the cook previously worked at the Munawwarpur shelter home. When Vaishali and Bhaskar introduced themselves, Sudha (Tanisha Mehta) refused to utter a word. She denied knowing or seeing anything unlawful during her time there. Vaishali gave up and was about to leave when Sudha decided to confess the truth under one condition: she was not ready to go on record, and she did not want her name associated with the case.Sudha spoke about her haunting memories at the shelter home. She brought up Baby Rani (Gulista Alija), the shelter warden, and how she mistreated the girls. She used to force the girls to sleep naked while she assaulted them. The 40-45 girls at the shelter had only one room to sleep in, and their health condition was extremely poor.
One of the girls advised Sudha to run for her life, and she soon figured out the reason behind it. They had a doctor who took care of cases where the victims were injured to an extreme degree. Later, Sudha watched Bansi and his men party (including Mithilesh) at the shelter home, and they abused and tortured the girls at random. She realized she, too, would meet the same fate and decided to run away that very night. Before leaving, she heard Baby Rani and Sonu (Satyakam Anand) mention killing a girl they had pimped out.
The details left Vaishali and Bhaskar speechless. They were all the more determined to expose the perpetrators and rescue the victims. The only problem was that the only witness Vaishali had was not willing to come forward. She soon realized that even though there was a lack of evidence, she had to act confidently to force the abusers to react, and that would eventually lead to one blunder or another.When Vaishali learned that a PIL had been filed against the Munawwarpur shelter home, she assumed her brother-in-law, lawyer Suresh Singh (Danish Iqbal), was behind it. Suresh was completely against Vaishali's decision to look into Bansi Sahu's business. He always looked down upon the work she did, especially because she did not fit into the typical idea of a 'good Indian housewife.' Bansi's men also thought that Suresh was responsible for the PIL, and they roughed him up to teach Vaishali a lesson. Surprisingly, Arvind showed confidence in the work Vaishali had undertaken, and now that she had his support, it was impossible to deter her from exposing the criminals.Vaishali decided to constantly update her audience about the case, and she discussed the torture Suresh was subjected to and how the police refused to file an FIR against Bansi Sahu. Vaishali's small endeavor all of a sudden caught the attention of the common people as well as the influential. She approached the first female SSP of Munawwarpur, Jasmeet Gaur (Sai Tamhankar), to seek help. While Jasmeet was hopeful that she would find a solution, her senior advised her to stay out of it because of the lack of evidence in the case. The next time Jasmeet and Vaishali met, she helped her understand the importance of putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department. Only after Social Welfare Department files in FIR, can the Police do anything.
Meanwhile, it is revealed that it was Guptaji who filed the PIL in Patna High Court.Brijmohan Singh's (Pravin Kumar Sisodia) wife, Rajni Singh (Vibha Chibbar), headed the Social Welfare Department, but he was the one who made all decisions on her behalf. Brijmohan was one of Bansi's many clients, and they maintained a close relationship.
Vaishali realized that the only way she could put pressure on the Social Welfare Department was with believable lies. Bhaskar Sinha was assigned the task of pretending to be a well-wisher of Brijmohan. He managed to meet the politician and warned him of the evidence Vaishali had gathered against him and his wife. To instigate a misunderstanding between Bansi and his men, Bhaskar mentioned that Mithilesh Sinha (Chittaranjan Tripathy) from CWC was responsible for providing information to Vaishali.
Later that night, Vaishali discussed on her show the death of an officer from the Sitamarhi Social Welfare Department, and she believed that he was shot dead because he was putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department to look into the Munawwarpur shelter home case. With a white sheet in her hand, Vaishali claimed that she had every bit of information on how the Munawwarpur shelter home for girls operated. She stated that the next day, she would finally expose all the ministers and well-known personalities involved in the racket on her special program, Bhakshak.After the program was aired, the Chief Minister contacted Rajni Singh and instructed her to file an FIR immediately. Vaishali was hopeful that Jaspreet Gaur would be able to take the case forward from henceforth, but as it turned out, the FIR was filed in the woman's police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act. The Child Welfare Association would record the testimonies of the victim, and if they found anything worth investigating, action would be taken. Vaishali knew there was no hope because Bansi's close aide, Mithilesh Sinha, also a sexual predator, headed the Child Welfare Association. After speaking to the SSP, Vaishali realized that the only way to get the culprits behind bars was by gathering evidence.Vaishali decides to meet Sudha once again and convince her to come forward with her story. Sudha was not ready to endanger her life by becoming a witness in the case, but Vaishali helped her realize how she alone could save the lives of all the abused children. Sudha finally agreed to have her statement recorded. She stood before the camera with her face covered and narrated her entire experience.
Bansi and his associates realized it was the end of their free will. Bansi was an egoistic man, and he did not feel an ounce of shame for the heinous crime he committed. He did not allow Baby Rani and Sonu to throw away the bottles of alcohol and contraceptives stored at the shelter home. He was proud of himself, and he did not try to conceal the crime. Mithilesh walked away from Bansi, fearing losing his job. The next morning, police arrived at the Munawwarpur shelter home and rescued the girls. Bansi and his associates were arrested, and justice was finally served.Vaishali Singh addresses her audience, discussing how often the media fails to address issues of importance because of influence. At times, such cases are overlooked simply because they do not appeal to the audience as much as entertaining news does. She expresses her disappointment with the way the world functions, where there is a clear lack of emotion and sympathy, and people prefer to ignore rather than feel. Vaishali continues to play her part as a journalist, but she questions her audience, asking them if they are doing enough to be called human beings in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: Towards the close of 2012, amidst the widespread speculation about an impending apocalypse, Antares de la Luz, the charismatic leader of a sect in Chile, adeptly manipulates his followers into unwavering obedience under the guise of salvation. This manipulation precipitates a descent into a chilling spiral of terror, culminating in the commission of one of the most heinous crimes in the annals of the nation's history. Through the lens of this Netflix documentary, individuals who were once under his sway recount their experiences, shedding light on how he insidiously usurped their autonomy, subjugating their wills and lives to the extent of distorting their consciences and reason.—Fabula</p>

The squad had inspired the country on their journey to England's first major final since 1966, and the European Championship was within their reach. But as England supporters arrived at Wembley from all corners of the country, celebration quickly turned to chaos. Mayhem took over with scenes of drunkenness and drug-taking, and ticketless fans saw an opportunity to storm the stadium. With compelling first-hand testimony and visceral user-generated content, this is the dramatic story of a day that began with euphoria, and ended in a nation left reeling.</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are excited about the fun nature of their latest catering gig, a by invitation only medieval ball and dinner at Sir Alistair Harrows' home, Hyde Castle, it a fundraiser for Elk Park Prep Academy, the school that Olive attends, she who will be part of a fencing demonstration at the gala. A stickler for authenticity as his home is one big medieval castle without the latest technology such as computers, Internet or cell phones, Sir Alistair dictates to his butler Klaus that all the guests must be dressed in medieval costume, and only invited guests are to be allowed in. Among the guests are many from the Elk Park Police Department, including Tom, Mason and Dave. One uninvited person who is able to make his way in, just before a storm snows them all in, is US Marshal Gerard Trach, Dave's father, who has come to see Tom to question him about his convict father Edmund Schultz as he has escaped from prison, odd in that he would soon be eligible for parole after twenty-five years served for murder. Tom knows nothing about Edmund's whereabouts as he has not spoken to his father since he went to prison, with this news dampening his spirit just before he and Goldy are to go on a big date. Something else that dampens the entire evening is a murder, the victim who was just about to make a self-described earth-shattering announcement. Tom leads the investigation, with Mason and Dave providing official assistance, Gerard somewhat unofficial assistance, and Goldy her inherent sleuthing skills. Even if they don't know the nature of the victim's announcement, they discover that there are many possible suspects as the victim had many enemies among the guests who can't leave even if they wanted to because of the snow. But what Tom probably did not expect is that his father would factor into the proceedings.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are excited about the fun nature of their latest catering gig, a by invitation only medieval ball and dinner at Sir Alistair Harrows' home, Hyde Castle, it a fundraiser for Elk Park Prep Academy, the school that Olive attends, she who will be part of a fencing demonstration at the gala. A stickler for authenticity as his home is one big medieval castle without the latest technology such as computers, Internet or cell phones, Sir Alistair dictates to his butler Klaus that all the guests must be dressed in medieval costume, and only invited guests are to be allowed in. Among the guests are many from the Elk Park Police Department, including Tom, Mason and Dave. One uninvited person who is able to make his way in, just before a storm snows them all in, is US Marshal Gerard Trach, Dave's father, who has come to see Tom to question him about his convict father Edmund Schultz as he has escaped from prison, odd in that he would soon be eligible for parole after twenty-five years served for murder. Tom knows nothing about Edmund's whereabouts as he has not spoken to his father since he went to prison, with this news dampening his spirit just before he and Goldy are to go on a big date. Something else that dampens the entire evening is a murder, the victim who was just about to make a self-described earth-shattering announcement. Tom leads the investigation, with Mason and Dave providing official assistance, Gerard somewhat unofficial assistance, and Goldy her inherent sleuthing skills. Even if they don't know the nature of the victim's announcement, they discover that there are many possible suspects as the victim had many enemies among the guests who can't leave even if they wanted to because of the snow. But what Tom probably did not expect is that his father would factor into the proceedings.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Renowned Korean shaman and her protégé, Hwa-rim (Kim Go-eun) and Bong-gil (Lee Do-hyun) are enlisted by a wealthy Korean American family to identify the mysterious illness of the family's newborn son. Hwa-rim uncovers the curse to be a 'Grave's Call', a vengeful ancestor's spirit haunting them. The family's patriarch, Park Ji-Yong, entrust them to relocate the grave to appease the ancestor, his grandfather. Hwa-rim enlists colleagues, a Feng shui master Kim Sang-deok (Choi Min-sik) and a mortician Yeong-geun (Yoo Hae-jin).Sang-deok specializes in selling burial locations for the wealthy, while Yeong-geun owns a funeral home. During their first encounter with Ji-yong, Sang-deok becomes wary when Ji-yong insists on cremating the grave, which is located in a remote mountain near the North Korean border. Sang-deok backs out, sensing a sinister energy. However, Hwa-rim convinces them that she can perform rituals while the grave is being dug to avoid the curse. Ji-yong tells them about a famous monk named 'Gisune,' who provided the grave location for his grandfather.Hwa-rim and Bong-gil perform the ritual, and the excavation proceeds smoothly. One of the grave-diggers severs the head of a human-headed snake, which triggers a bad omen. Yeong-geun insists on cremating the coffin once the rain stops so they store it at a nearby ward. The local custodian opens the coffin and releases the vengeful entity inside, Ji-yong's grandfather. The entity targets his bloodline, killing Ji-yong's parents and Ji-yong himself. The grandfather is revealed to be a Japanese loyalist during the Korean occupation era. Before he can reach the newborn baby, Sang-deok cremates the coffin, abolishing the curse.Months later, Yeong-geun informs Sang-deok about the disturbed gravedigger who killed a snake. He revisits the cursed gravesite and discovers the head of an 'onna' along with a double burial site for a seven-footed standing coffin. He enlists Hwa-rim, Bong-gil, and Yeong-geun to dispose of the coffin. The four excavate it and rest at a temple, where Hwa-rim learns about Gisune Monk, who is Japanese. That night, Bong-gil witnesses a seven-foot figure obliterating a human and pigs. They find the coffin ripped from the inside. Bong-gil gets possessed and the other three witness the creature turn into a ball of fire and fly back to the mountain. The four are taken to a hospital and Bong-gil recovers after surgery.Hwa-rim investigates the creature's origin through the possessed Bong-gil. Sang-deok returns to the grave and finds the creature dormant on the coordinates written on the tombstone. He discovers that the grave's robbers were Korean patriots attempting to unearth a metal pole as part of a Japanese military conquest in Korea. Sang-deok, Hwa-rim, and Yeong-geun devise to unearth the pole when the creature rises after midnight. Hwa-rim will distract the shogun while the others dig. A vision reveals Monk Kitsune embedding a katana inside a decapitated samurai's body, turning the samurai into a ghoul, with Ji-yong's grandfather's grave serving as a cover for the relic. Sang-deok realizes the pole is a sword embedded in the creature's body. Using the Korean patriots' wooden tool and blood, he slays the creature based on his elemental knowledge and regains consciousness with the others by his bedside. The four later attend Sang-deok's daughter's wedding.</p>

                            <p>Description: Title: Shadows of RomeChapter 1: A Call to ServiceSarah stood before the ornate gates of St. Peter's Basilica, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. She had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean from her small hometown in the heart of America to answer a calling she couldn't quite explain. At twenty-three, she felt a sense of purpose stirring within her, urging her to devote her life to the church.Raised in a devout Catholic family, Sarah had always felt a deep connection to her faith. Her parents, both staunch believers, had instilled in her a sense of duty and devotion from a young age. Now, as she stood on the threshold of this sacred place, she knew that her journey was just beginning.With a deep breath, Sarah pushed open the heavy gates and stepped into the grandeur of St. Peter's Square. The sight before her took her breath away. The magnificent basilica rose before her, its towering dome reaching toward the heavens. The square buzzed with the energy of pilgrims and tourists from around the world, their voices blending into a cacophony of languages.As Sarah made her way through the throngs of people, she felt a sense of peace settle over her. This was where she was meant to be, she was sure of it. She had been accepted into a program that would allow her to serve the church in Rome, assisting with various outreach programs and ministries. It was a dream come true for Sarah, a chance to immerse herself in the heart of Catholicism and deepen her connection to God.Chapter 2: A Haunting PresenceIn the days that followed, Sarah threw herself into her work with zeal. She found fulfillment in helping those less fortunate, whether it was serving meals at a local soup kitchen or volunteering at a homeless shelter. But amidst the joy of serving others, Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.It started with a sense of unease that lingered in the back of her mind, like a shadow lurking just out of sight. Sarah dismissed it at first, attributing it to the overwhelming nature of her new surroundings. But as the days passed, the feeling only grew stronger.One evening, as Sarah made her way back to her modest apartment after a long day of volunteering, she felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. It was as if someone-or something-was watching her, their eyes boring into her very soul. She quickened her pace, her heart pounding in her chest.Just as she reached the safety of her apartment building, Sarah heard a low, guttural sound emanating from the darkness behind her. She whirled around, her breath catching in her throat. But there was nothing there, only the empty street bathed in the soft glow of the streetlights.Shaken but determined to shrug off her unease, Sarah hurried inside and locked the door behind her. She told herself it was just her imagination running wild, that there was nothing to fear. But deep down, she knew that something was terribly wrong.Chapter 3: Uncovering the TruthAs the weeks passed, Sarah's sense of unease only intensified. She began to notice strange occurrences around the city-unexplained disappearances, whispered rumors of dark rituals performed in secret, and a pervasive sense of fear that hung in the air like a shroud.</p>

                            <p>Description: Ana (Camila Mendes) is an ambitious intern, dreaming of a career in the art world while trying to impress her demanding boss, Claire (Marisa Tomei) the head of Erwins New York. Ana hopes to earn Claire's recommendation to work at a top art gallery in New York. Claire is a sociopath perfectionist.
Because of the expensive cost of living in New York, Ana currently lives with her sister Vivian (Aimee Carrero) and Vivian's boyfriend Ronnie (Andrew Schulz), who has been urging her to move out.
Amy (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) is Ana's only friend at the office. During an auction at work, Ana realizes there has been a typo in the auction's catalog mislabeling the type of paint used on a piece that is about to be sold. Ana informs Claire of the error just in time to make the correction, gaining her a little respect. Claire fires Billy, the person who was in charge of the catalog.
The next morning Claire invites Ana to serve as the assistant to her assistants on an upcoming work trip to London. Claire asks Ana to pack her bags and to come straight to the airport.Upset by Ana's ambition, Claire's two assistants Suzette (Rachel Matthews) and Renee (Fola Evans-Akingbola) wait until the group is boarding their flight to reveal that they have booked Ana an economy ticket for a flight that leaves 4 hours later. The ticket agent at the check-in desk witnesses this mistreatment and decides to upgrade Ana's ticket to first class. While waiting for her flight in the first-class lounge Ana distractedly answers a phone call and proceeds to spill her Bloody Mary on a wealthy man named William (Archie Renaux). Ana and William end up sitting next to each other on the flight to London and hit it off. During the flight, Ana accidentally leads William to believe she is the art director of her company's New York office. He is very impressed and when they land, introduces Ana to his mother, Catherine (Lena Olin), who is a British celebrity. Catherine is introduced to Ana, and she offers to drop Ana at her hotel.
Catherine and Ana hit it off and she even takes Ana's number to stay in touch.Suzette and Renee continue to sabotage Ana, assigning her an office in the basement and a room at a separate cheaper hotel, while they stay at the Carlson, a swanky hotel 4 streets from William's home.
Arnold (Thomas Kretschmann) is the head of the company and is leading the sale of the prestigious Brovil collection, whose owner is known only to Arnold. Arnold has brought in Gerard (head of Paris office) and Claire to overlook the sale and ensure its success. Arnold is due to retire, which means both Gerard and Claire are up for the top job.
Ana receives a voicemail informing her that she left her laptop in Williams's car. That night she goes to Catherine's house to retrieve her laptop and finds herself in the middle of a party. There she sees Catherine's extensive art collection (which belonged to her husband, who passed away), meets a famous painter, and continues to lie about being the director of a New York auction house named Erwins.
Ana tells Catherine that her husband was a romantic, since his art collection tells a story of love. Catherine reveals that she recently asked Erwins to auction her collection. Her last name is Brovil. Catherine says that she is working with Claire and says that she will ask Arnold to work with Ana instead. Ana says that the sale is a secret, and she would get in trouble if Arnold found out that she was talking to Catherine.Suzette and Renee are tasked with getting last-minute tickets to a performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while continuing to assign Ana to all of the work they don't want to do. Desperate to get tickets to impress Claire, Ana asks Catherine who leaves tickets with William. Ana visits William who is coaching an at-risk youth soccer league. William invites her to have lunch with him which she has to decline due to her workload. William also tells her that there is a party being thrown that evening and his mother, Catherine, wants Ana to attend. Before Ana leaves, Will clarifies that he would also like her to attend, as his date.Ana runs back to the London office and arrives just as Claire asks Suzette if she got the tickets. Suzette is forced to admit that she was not able to and is further embarrassed when Ana shows her up and turns in the tickets to Claire. Background tensions rise as Gerard (Gregory Montel), the art director for the Paris office, and Claire are both vying for the company's head director position.Ana attends the party, with William and Catherine, in a designer dress that she "borrowed" from Claire (Claire had given the dress to Ana for dry-cleaning). Catherine admits to Ana that she is having second thoughts about selling her collection, due to the love of her husband that it represents.
When she suddenly sees Claire arrive with Suzette and Renee, she is scared her lie will be revealed and attempts to run off. Will catches her before she leaves and instead takes her to go dancing at a local bar. At the end of the night, William wants to take Ana back to her hotel. Embarrassed by where she is actually staying, Ana has William drop her off at Claire's much nicer hotel and makes an excuse to prevent him from coming inside. Before leaving, William confesses that he is falling in love with her.Over the next week, Ana and William continue to spend time together, growing closer and developing their relationship. William tells Ana that he has spent his whole life being used by other people but that she is different, and he admires her for being down-to-earth and humble despite her wealth and success. He tells her he knows her job is important and that he has arranged to transfer his work to New York so that they can continue their relationship.At the office, Claire praises Ana's hard work and promises that there will be a promotion in her future. Renee interrupts their meeting to reveal that a major client has just pulled out of their upcoming auction. That client is Catherine, William's mother. At that same moment, William arrives to surprise Ana at work, and she rushes him out of the building. William tells Ana that he had nothing to do with his mother's decision and doesn't understand why she is acting so strange. He questions whether Ana was just using him to secure his mother's sale and breaks up with her.When Ana goes back into the building, she is confronted by Claire who has discovered her lie and her relationship with William's family. She is fired and escorted out of the building.Ana visits Catherine and confesses that she is not the successful art director she was pretending to be. Instead of being upset, Catherine is proud of Ana for her honesty. She says that she was also using Ana by pretending to walk away from the auction to get a better deal from Erwins who had offered her 85 million pounds for her collection.
Catherine agrees to rejoin the auction on the condition that Ana is the one who handles the sale. Ana kicks Gerard off the auction and puts Claire in total control. Ana is re-hired and manages to sell Catherine's art for much more than expected (250 million pounds). She goes back to the soccer field and apologizes to William who tells her that he didn't like her because she was rich, he liked her because he thought she was an honest person.Ana returns to New York and six months later she has not heard from William but is thriving in her career. Ana throws a party to celebrate the opening of her own art gallery. At the end of the night, after everyone else has left, William arrives with a suitcase.</p>

But underneath his seemingly normal exterior, Orion is a ball of adolescent anxiety, completely consumed by irrational fears of bees, dogs, the ocean, cell phone waves, murderous gutter clowns, and even falling off of a cliff. But of all his fears, the thing he's the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grows closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.</p>

                            <p>Description: Specializing in the works of Jane Austen, Dr. Eloise Cavendish is the keynote speaker at this year's Jane Austen League of America (JALA) conference and ball. This annual event is only the second time she's ever attended as, as an academic through and through, she doesn't much like the "ball" component, with many attendees treating JALA like one big Regency costume party. She doesn't even really see Austen, as most do, as a romance novelist in her rather clinical perspective. In addition to being able to visit with Mia Cavendish, her drama queen of a sister at the same time in Mia living in town, Eloise primarily accepted the invitation to meet and impress Dr. Victoria Jennings, one of the event organizers who is part of the hiring committee for a job at Princeton, a job Eloise would very much like. Unlike most, single Eloise is dismayed literally to meet "Mr. Darcy", he really Sam Lee, someone hired to dress and act like Mr. Darcy to provide some color to JALA. Her dismay is that Sam is doing double duty as her special guest liaison to JALA, including immersing her into what is somewhat expected of her in the "costume party" aspect. Eloise hates to admit that she needs Sam's help to impress Dr. Jennings, while she in turn helps him with a somewhat personal matter also associated to Dr. Jennings. The question becomes whether Eloise and Sam can bridge their differences in helping each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Peter Barrett (Charlie Weber), a CIA covert operative, is approached at a diner by a man in disguise. The man is revealed to be Peter's CIA superior and adopted father, Henry Byrne (Jon Voight). Byrne had adopted Peter after Peter's parents, who were close with Byrne, were killed in a terrorist attack and Peter temporarily lost his hearing. Peter's hearing returned, though now ultra sensitive, giving him ultrasonic hearing.The mission is track at Russian arms dealer/drug smuggler, download the contents of his watch, and then eliminate them. After Byrne leaves, Peter calls his pregnant wife, Elena Maran (Rryla McIntosh), who is also a CIA agent.The mission starts well with Peter easily capturing the target (Doug Chapman), downloading the contents, and wiping out the target's bodyguards. Once the download is complete, which the target had to be alive for, Peter goes to kill the target but is stopped by Elena and two other agents. The target has been the subject of a year long investigation and Elena's team need him to stand trial. Peter hesitates on what to do and the target grabs a gun firing at Peter. Peter is grazed by the bullet but shoots and kills the target. Elena, however, is hit directly in the stomach.Elena survives but loses the baby and eventually leaves Peter. Peter relationship with Byrne also falls apart as Peter blames Byrne for ordering the mission knowing Elena could show up, though Byrne denies knowing that her team was involved.Seventeen years later Elena is still working for the CIA, while Peter is now living a life of solitude as a painter in the mountains in Cascade, Oregon. Elena receives incriminating evidence about the CIA from her colleague, Dennis (Stephen Lobo), shortly before he is killed by an assassin looking for the evidence.Peter, now going by the alias Mark Nicholson, receives a package addressed to Peter Barrett. The packages contain two art books with an inscription from Elena, something she used to do when they were married as he'd always drip paint on the books.He later visits a bar run by his friend Lucy (Leah Gibson). While there Peter is approached by a teenage girl, Sophia (Madison Bailey), who addresses him as Peter. Sophia is Elena's daughter and says her mom told her to find Peter Barrett if anything ever happens to her. Elena is now missing and Sophia found Peter hoping he'd help find her. Peter denies that he is Peter or that he knows Sophia's mother.Sophie follows Peter home and eventually gets him to admit his identity after discovering a painting of her mom. She confronts Peter and claims she is his daughter too, but the house is then attacked by mercenaries with Sophia killing the final attacker. Peter and Sophia flee the house with Peter grabbing a few belongings, including the art books that Elena had sent.Naomi Piasecki (Marie Avgeropoulos), Section Chief for the CIA, watches body cam footage of Peter's attack. She calls in Agent Kim (Luisa d'Oliviera) and orders a manhunt to be put on for Peter, who she accuses of going rogue and murdering eight federal agents who were there to investigate him for possession of classified information.Piasecki and Kim deliver the news to Byrne, now a high ranking CIA official. He is furious that agents when it like they did and accuses the CIA using Piasecki to cover-up old messes. Piasecki tells Kim to put a tail and track on Byrne, believing he is hiding something.Peter and Sophia find Niles (Jason Gray-Stanford), the owner of a computer hardware/software store, and asks him to hack into the CIA network and determine why he was attacked. Niles at first refuses knowing how to, but after Peter shows him his gun Niles agrees to help. He finds that Peter's record is now classified and Elena is claimed to have went dark on a mission.Peter calls Byrne who tells Peter that two agents came to his house asking about him. Peter agrees to meet with Byrne in secret, believing Byrne is the best chance to find Elena. Agent Kim is able to trace Niles' hacking to Cascade, Oregon and sends a team to retrieve him.Sophia once again confronts Peter about him lying and though he feels guilt about lying, he still denies being her father. Meanwhile, eccentric CIA assassin Ghost (Max Montesi), who had previously killed Elena's colleague Dennis, arrives in Cascade and goes through Peter's apartment tracking him to Lucy's bar.Peter meets with Byrne demanding to know why the CIA tried to kill him. Byrne says he doesn't know but has pieced together that Piasecki believes Peter is in possession of something that greatly threatens national security. When asked about Sophia's identity, Byrne also rejects the possibility that Peter and Elena are the parents.Ghost attacks Lucy at the bar and demands to know where Peter went, though she denies knowing Peter. Peter takes Byrne to meet Sophia and he begins aggressively questioning her at gun point. However, Sophia easily answers all of Byrne's questions and he agrees to call in a check on Elena's status, which reveals that Elena was killed in service. Sophia maintains that Elena had to have sent her to Peter for a reason, but Peter once again confirms he hasn't had any contact with Elena for years. He promises Sophia that he is going to find out what happened to Elena and take care of whoever did it.Peter examines the art books that she sent and finds a small flash drive inside the spine. He leaves Sophia with Byrne and heads out. Piasecki and Kim arrive in Cascade and Kim reveals that Byrne is nowhere to be found.Peter takes the flash drive to Niles, who Byrne confirmed Peter's suspicion of being a CIA operative sent to keep an eye on Peter, for decryption. The files all pertain to a CIA black-ops program called The Internship. Peter hears Ghost approaching and he takes cover with Niles. Ghost uses a high pitched whistle to incapacitate to Peter, but he still escapes the store with the flash drive. Ghost questions Niles for information, though it is clear that Ghost knows about The Internship, and then kills him.Peter goes to Lucy's bar and finds her beaten to death. He reviews the files and finds a video from Elena. Elena explains that the The Internship was a program run by the CIA that stole young children to train them to become the perfect assassins. Dennis, Elena's colleague, was attempting to remove an asset from the program when he was killed. Elena also confirms that Sophia is their daughter, telling Peter that she doesn't know how but she's alive. The video breaks out after Elena tells Peter he must protect her and that Sophia is in danger.Peter races back to Byrne and Sophia but finds that Piasecki's CIA operatives have already arrived. He is attacked and kills two guards before Sophia is dragged into the back of a van and driven away as Peter and Byrne fire at the car. Byrne tells Peter to go follow the van and he'll be able to hide himself.Byrne is intercepted by more operatives and Piasecki orders them to eliminate Peter over the objections of Agent Kim. The agents open fire on his truck blowing it up, but not before Peter is able to escape.Peter, who is barely conscious from his wounds, is found that night by Junk Man, a French homeless man who is often found around Cascade. Agent Kim reveals to Piasecki that they have found no evidence of Peter and Piasecki orders them to end the search. The Junk Man is revealed to be Byrne in disguise, who has taken to Peter to a secret bunker for recovery.Piasecki and Kim interrogate Sophia who reveals that she is Elena and Peter's daughter, accusing Piasecki of killing her mother. Piasecki denies that the CIA wants to kill Peter or had anything to do with Elena and then threaten her for more information. She orders everyone, including Agent Kim, out of the room.Peter and Byrne review the files show that Piasecki is running The Internship program, which temporarily dulls certain senses to hope they recover like Peter's did, creating the ultimate assassin team. However, before they can continue looking through the files it receives a virus and self-destructs.Peter remembers that Elena sent two books and likely put a second copy in the other book. Byrne wants to go get it but Peter refuses, owing it to Elena to find Sophia first. He uses a tracker he had given her earlier to locate her, taking some weapons from the stockpile that Byrne had.Agent Kim criticizes Piasecki for breaking protocol with the interrogation and threatens to report her. Piasecki claims she'll report herself after the threat is neutralized and reveals a tracker she found Sophia, something Kim missed in her previous search. Piasecki warns that Peter is coming and to prepare for an attack.Agent Kim orders the agents to various defensive positions but Peter easily infiltrates the facility killing multiple agents. Peter reaches the control room and fights off the agents. Kim leaves Piasecki to help get Sophia to safety. Piasecki intercepts them bringing them to a different part of the facility. She orders Agent Kim to leave them but when Kim refuses, she is shot and killed by Piasecki.Peter is attacked by Ghost who reveals himself to be an alum of the Internship. Ghost wants to be the one who kills Peter, who. he refers to as "Patient Zero." Peter tries to break through to Ghost and get him to escape from the CIA but Ghost mocks him and attacks again. Ghost nearly beats Peter but after revealing that he killed Elena, he infuriates Peter who grabs a wood shard and stabs Ghost through the eye killing him.Peter finds Piasecki and the two fire at each other with Piasecki revealed to have heightened senses as well. She explains that she was an Intern who know leads the program. Sophia arrives with two CIA guards. She orders Peter to put his weapon down and hand over the flash drive.However, Byrne arrives killing the two guards and forcing Piasecki to put her gun down. Peter turns his gun on Byrne accusing him of starting The Internship and being Piasecki's superior, which Byrne admits to. Byrne apologizes for involving Peter, saying they only wanted to find the information. Peter claims Byrne is only trying to save his legacy but he claims Sophia is his new legacy and hands her a gun which she points at Peter. Sophia orders Peter to give over the flash drive but when he refuses she shoots him in the arm. Byrne claims she is the new perfect weapon, kidnapping her after she was born and "pronounced dead." Peter tries to get through to Sophia, telling her that Byrne kidnapped her and after Elena was sent the files and discovered the truth, she confronted Byrne and he had her killed by Ghost. He begs her to decide for herself and not be controlled by Byrne. He tells her how much he loved her mother and her mother loved her while Byrne orders her to kill Peter. She turns the gun killing Byrne and wounding Piasecki.Sophia still expresses admiration for Byrne, but telling Peter he was thinking too small. She warns Peter she is coming for the flash drive and likely won't remember he is her father but she and Peter have a small farewell.Peter returns home and finds the other copy. He opens the files and finds the video that cut off earlier. Elena confirms his theories about Byrne and tells him he must help all of The Interns. He smiles as he hears a sniper zoning in and sees Sophia with it.</p>

The spirit of this curse seems to have rubbed off somewhat on her longtime best friend Mya who is facing one disaster after another in her wedding preparations to her fiancé Raul. With Betty, she has a history of pulling away from any boyfriend on the slightest hint of any harm coming to him. Betty believes the stars already have it in for her when she is attracted to her new neighbor Alex in he going into the world's danger zones as a photojournalist. Beyond his job, Alex is a risk taker in wanting to live life to the fullest. As they spend more time together, Betty has to decide what to do in really liking him but not wanting to see any harm come to him.—Huggo</p>

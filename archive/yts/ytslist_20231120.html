                            <p>Description: Poor Boy centers on two families whose lives become mysteriously linked by events that occurred seven years earlier.

By the time the story reaches its redemptive finale, the characters have a deeper understanding of who they are, and of the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships, as they, and the audience, are left to question their own sense of self."</p>

                            <p>Description: Balas and Kovar's on-screen chemistry brings the story to life, delivering a powerful and thought-provoking performance that explores the depths of love and loss. The filmmakers Zachary Gutierrez and Joshua LaBure bring their signature eye for intimate visual narratives with an autumnal setting in Omaha, adding a layer of beauty to the film's visual narrative, while the rawness of the acting and the complexity of the relationship makes it an emotionally charged viewing experience. Overall, the film captures the essence of a second chance at love and the challenges that come with it, creating a powerful and poignant story.—James Isreal</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2011, Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernán Reyes, attempts to stop Dominic "Dom" Toretto and Brian O'Conner from stealing the vault containing the fortune of his father. However, Dom uses the vault to ram Dante's turreted SUV into the ocean, but Dante survives and swears revenge against Dom.
After stopping the upload of Project Ares, Dom continues raising his son Brian "Little B" Marcos with his wife Letty Ortiz. Later, they are visited by Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, Ramsey, Han Lue and Dom's grandmother Abuelita Toretto for a family reunion. After the reunion, the team are assigned for a new mission in Rome, where Dom and Letty decide to stay behind. That night, cyberterrorist Cipher arrives at Dom's house after being betrayed by her team that joined forces with Dante, as the latter blackmailed them with threats to kill their families. Cipher warns him that Dante is after his family and they are in danger. The next day, Little Nobody arrives to take Cipher into custody and confirms to Dom and Letty that Cipher told them the truth, but he also tells them that he never assigned a mission to the team.
Realizing that they were sent to Dante's trap and unable to communicate with them, Dom and Letty travel to Rome to rescue the team. In Rome, the team is imprisoned in a truck controlled by Dante, containing a time bomb set to explode. Dom and Letty arrive in order to aid the team by managing to stop the truck, but the bomb is released through the streets causing mayhem across the way where Little Nobody is almost killed by a bomb that Dante implanted in his car. Having no time to deactivate the bomb, Dom takes it to the river in order to prevent it from reaching the Vatican. Though Dom manages to do it, the bomb explodes and a great part of the city is destroyed. Dom and his crew are blamed for the destruction and become international fugitives, with Letty being arrested while the rest of the team manages to escape. Aimes, The new leader of Mr. Nobody's organization, believes that Dom's crew is responsible for the attack and starts a manhunt to capture them.
In Los Angeles, a special forces team arrives to take Little B, who was under the care of Dom's sister Mia. Soon they are joined by Dom's brother Jakob (having been contacted by Dom) and overpowers the squad. Jakob parts ways with Mia, taking Little B to protect him. Mr Nobody's daughter Tess, who is convinced of Dom's innocence, uses God's Eye in order to find him in a bar. Tess reveals Dante's identity and warns him that Aimes is going after them. Dom travels to Rio de Janeiro to confront Dante, while Tess goes to the prison where Letty is being held to deliberately wound her and sent her to have her wound treated, under Dom's request. At Rio de Janeiro, Dom confronts Dante, where he challenges him to a race. They are joined by other two street racers: Diogo, a friend of Dom's, and Isabel Neves, the sister of Little B's mother Elena Neves, whom Cipher killed.
During the race, Dante tells Dom that he implanted two bombs in the two cars of the other racers and that he must choose who is going to save. Diogo is killed by the explosion, but Dom saves Isabel's life before the bomb explodes, stopping to aid Isabel while Dante wins the race. The following day, Dom arrives at one of Dante's prisons and realizes that his family has been being watched for years. Dom receives a call from Dante vowing to kill his family, while Aimes arrives with his squad and arrests Dom. In London, the rest of Dom's crew discover that their bank accounts were hacked leaving them penniless, except for the dollars that Roman was hiding. While seeking supplies, they soon learn that whoever turns them in to the authorities, would receive a cash reward in the millions.
Without any choice, the team are forced to meet Deckard Shaw and ask him for help. Shaw is initially reluctant to accept, but soon agrees to help them after learning that his mother is a fugitive for helping Dom. While Dom is being taken into custody, Aimes and his team are soon attacked by Dante's mercenaries. Aimes join forces with Dom to fight them, while Dom soon starts to fight Dante. However this was revealed to be a trap as Dante has kidnapped Isabel. Tess arrives to help Dom but is wounded by a sniper hired by Dante and steals God's Eye, which he uses to go after Brian in Portugal. Dom manages to save Isabel as Dante escapes in a helicopter. Isbael takes Tess to the hospital while Aimes, recognizing Dom's innocence, agrees to help him. The rest of Dom's crew also realizes that Dante has God's Eye and travels to Portugal to stop him.
Arriving at Portugal, Jakob and Little B are chased by a group of mercenaries, where the two initially manage to overpower them. However, Dante manages to kidnap Little B. Dom arrives at Portugal to rescue Brian where he is confronted by the remaining mercenaries. Realizing that his brother is about to be killed and having his supply tank compromised, Jakob sacrifices himself to kill the remaining mercenaries and give enough time for Dom to rescue Little B. After destroying two helicopters, Dom is able to rescue Little B only to be confronted by two trailers that they were going to crash in an attempt to kill Dom. The plane with Dom's remaining crew also arrives, but is later destroyed by Aimes, who is revealed to have been working for Dante all the time, apparently killing them.
With no choice, Dom and Little B barely escape by jumping off the dam. Dante reveals that he implanted bombs on the dam with the intention of destroying them, anticipating that Dom would escape, having studied every step that Dom would take. Letty is taken to a secret hospital prison to have her wounds treated, where she soon finds Cipher. Though the two initially engage into fight, they start to work together and learn that they are in Antarctica. The two escape and soon they are rescued by Gisele Yashar, having survived falling off the plane after her sacrifice to save Han.
In a mid-credit scene, during a mission with several operative agents, Luke Hobbs receives a call from Dante, who reveals that given Dom only crashed his father's car, and Hobbs was the one who shot Hernàn dead, Hobbs will be Dante's next target after Dom.</p>

By June of 1986, they played their very last gig at Wembley Stadium having done exactly that. Now, for the very first time, told in their own words, comes the amazing story of how in four years they dominated the charts around the world with timeless and classic pop songs. Hit after hit "Club Tropicana," "Wake Me Up Before You Go Go," "Freedom," "I'm Your Man" and of course "Last Christmas." Their time in the spotlight was white-hot, and they became the very first Western pop act to play in China. It was a time that both encapsulated and epitomized not just their youth but also that of the many millions of fans that adored them.</p>

                            <p>Description: A notorious serial killer, Edward Brady, is facing execution at 11pm. Dr. James Martin is brought in to replace Dr. Alan Fischer who committed suicide after interviewing Edward. Edward's fate now depends on Martin's diagnosis. If Martin decides that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if he declares him to be insane, Edward will be spared. "Edward" claims that he is possessed by a demon named "Nefariamus", and also says that Martin will commit three murders by day's end. Martin initially dismisses Edward's claims, but as the demon's knowledge of Martin's life proves uncannily and disturbingly accurate, Martin's skepticism begins to fade. The weight of Nefarious' claims both frighten him and fill him with self doubts. With Edward's fate hanging in the balance, Martin must make a fateful decision based on his professional diagnosis, while grappling with his personal feelings of fear and disgust, and the conflict of interest they create.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

                            <p>Description: Ultimate planner Emma looks like she will finally be reaching the pinnacle of what has been her extended five year plan, namely the Chair of the Department in her boss, Nancy, intimating that she is retiring at the end of the semester. Despite Nancy having mentored her in Emma having made it clear that she has long wanted the job, Emma has always had the feeling that traditional and hard-nosed Nancy doesn't really respect her, especially in that they are two vastly different people. Beyond extending that five year plan to accommodate Nancy's delay in retirement, Emma has let Paolo add to her five year plan to insert himself into her life and future. Even though he had always seen himself living in Italy, Paolo marrying Emma has provided the opportunity for the family to expand the business into the US market in they opening their first US store in Chicago. Paolo has hired his cousin Matteo to help him manage the store, timely for Matteo, from Miami, in recently having broken up with his girlfriend thus having nothing to prevent him from making the move. The veil being currently on display in the store is an issue for Emma's teaching assistant Lily, she avoiding it in a measure of protection from being hurt in seeing her quirky self as traditionally not being the type of woman attractive to the type of man she would like, this all despite signs being that there is potentially *the* man right in front of her. With all these things going on in Emma and Paolo's lives, one other thing enters into it as a factor which places them at a crossroads in their marriage where her long term plan and his long term plan may be incompatible.—Huggo</p>

After their departure, Jayaram is frightened as he is the investor in the factory whose construction is blocked by Veera Simha Reddy.Jayaram indicates the presence of Veera Simha Reddy in Turkey where Pratap Reddy and Bhanumati arrive and finishes him, while also revealing that Bhanumati is Veera Simha Reddy's sister. Jai attempts to save Veera Simha Reddy, who stops him saying that he can die repeatedly for Bhanumathi. Before leaving his breath, Veera Simha Reddy instructs Jai to perform his final rights in his motherland. As per guidelines, Jai carries his father's corpse to Rayalaseema and conducts the funeral between a great multitude of fanatics drowning under woe. Following, Jai questions the underlying reason for Bhanumati's enmity against her brother when Siddhappa, Veera Simha Reddy's trusted lieutenant divulges the past. Bhanumati was the illicit child of Veera Simha Reddy's father, yet he idolized and dedicated his life to her. Meenakshi was his cross-cousin who endeared him from childhood and was betrothed to him.

Apart from that, every year customary contests are held in that area where Veera Simha Reddy triumphs. However, Pratap Reddy subterfuged him when Shekar took part to protect Veera Simha Reddy's reputation and was beaten. At this point, Pratap Reddy heckled Shekar and exaggerated his anger. Furious, a drunkard Shekar indulged in gunfire that inadvertently killed a villager Suri. Currently, Veera Simha Reddy uprights piety and ostracized Shekar, who later committed suicide. Heartbroken, Bhanumati pledged to seek vengeance. On that account, she married Pratap Reddy and commanded him not to touch her before Veera Simha Reddy's death. Thus, Veera Simha Reddy lifts Pratap Reddy alive for his sister and decided to renunciation all comforts as a penalty, where he requested Meenakshi to quit his life, who reluctantly agreed and had hidden her pregnancy.After the revelation, Siddhappa tells Jai to retrieve back. Raj Gopal switches to surrendering the factory to miscreants. Jai strikes on them to perpetuate his father's ambition and also challenges Pratap to enter without his aunt's background. Infuriated by Jai's comment, Pratap Reddy smacks Bhanumati asserting that he is the one who instigated vengeance in her mind by killing Shekar. Distraught, Bhanumati meets Jai and apologizes to him, where she kills herself by slitting her throat. During the time of her cremation, Pratap Reddy attacks Jai. However, Jai manages to finish Pratap Reddy and merges his aunt's ashes in his father's grave, where he continues his father's legacy.</p>

Waking up on the forested planet of Anthemusa, Caleb (Anthony Nikolchev), the newcomer of the group, can't remember how or why he landed on a planet that, up until his arrival, was covered in dry sand. He meets a group of colonists led by Hunter (Veronica Wylie) who encountered the same problem but have yet to find a way out. Making matters worse is the disappearance of their mission commander, Victor (Eric Roberts), who appears to the team in the form of a floating head speaking in cryptic riddles and phrases. Believing that Victor has found a way out, the team searches for "the door" - an image that appears to them during meditation. Learning how to meditate, Caleb uses the technique to follow the missing whereabouts of Victor who speaks to the team from an unknown location that contains a mysterious "door." When the team catches up with Victor, they find more than a way out.</p>

                            <p>Description: Wealthy trader and serial killer David Robey (Andy Serkis) blackmails and kidnaps cleaner Callum Aldrich. DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) is assigned to the case and promises Callum's mother, Corinne (Hattie Morahan), he will find her son. Concerned about his involvement, Robey digs up dirt on the various illegal acts Luther has committed as a police officer (he comes across as a vigilante who takes law into his own hands and feels that the rules don't apply to him), resulting in him being fired, prosecuted and imprisoned.Years later, Robey coaxes Corrine and the parents of other victims to a house (he had kept them alive all these years) where he burns their children's corpses (the parents finds their kids hanging in the basement when they arrive at the house. A overheated mobile phone battery triggers a fire). The house belonged to a Saudi national, who hadn't set foot in Britain for several years.
Corrine visits Luther in prison, admonishing him for not finding her son's killer. Robey sends a recording of him murdering Callum to Luther in prison via a radio frequency (which was passed on to Luther in prison, via a note under his door). In a twist, it was Robey who drove Corrine to prison, as nobody still knows that Robey is behind the kidnappings and the murders. Robey has positioned himself as sympathetic to all the parents who lost their kids to the serial killer.
Luther informs DCI Odette Raine (Cynthia Erivo) over phone, the new head of Serious and Serial Crime, of the broadcast. Raine tells him that the killer sent the recordings to the families of all the 8 victims. Luther knows something big is coming and the killer is looking for an audience. Luther wants to be one step ahead of the killer. Raine tells Luther that she doesn't care about a dirty cops unfinished business and refuses to help him in any way.
He liaises with prison guards and former associate McCabe (Vincent Regan) to break him out of prison. Luther bribes the guards to let the other prisoners attack him (they hate Luther as he was a cop). This then becomes an excuse for the guards to transfer Luther to another prison, and for McCabe to break him out, en-route.Raine brings in retired DSU Martin Schenk (Dermot Crowley) as a consultant to help track down Luther. Schenk used to be Luther's boss. Raine promises to kill Luther, if he messes with her investigation. Luther finds the radio station that is broadcasting Robey's radio message. From the owner of the radio station Derek, he learns that the owner met a man online, who was into extreme submission porn. Derek was give an address and security codes for a meeting. Derek reached the place and found a man waiting for him, and proceeded to have sex with him. Derek later realized that this wasn't the man he met online, and that he had just raped a complete stranger. He then received blackmail threats and was told to play the broadcast tape without asking any questions. Luther takes the phone on which Derek is contacted.
Luther contacts SChenk and asks him to trace the number. Schenk keeps Raine in the loop.Luther traces Robey to Piccadilly Circus, where Raine deploys armed police SCO19 (since they both got their info from Schenk). The two confront Robey there (Luther calls the Killers phone and watches a man in a parka pick up), but some people Robey has blackmailed cause a distraction by killing themselves jumping from buildings and crashing cars. Robey escapes into the London Underground after fighting Luther and murdering an armed policeman (he cuts the man's artery in the leg, which causes him to bleed to death while Luther tries to save him).
An officer on Raine's team, Archie, is shown to be in cahoots with Robey.Luther speaks to Raine on the phone and speculates that the killer blackmails his victims to do his bidding. Luther meets Corrine and tells her that Callum was perhaps blackmailed too. He speculates that she has met the killer and that he is in her life. Corrine talks about a man named Tommy who met her at a support group after Callum's death.
Robey kidnaps Raine's daughter, Anya (Lauryn Ajufo). By now Raine knows the killer's real name. Robey wants Luther dead in exchange for Anya. Raine meets with Luther and reluctantly agrees to work with him. She tells Luther that Robey was suspected of sexual assault 6 yrs ago, but it was never proven. Then his wife was about to leave him, when she was caught in a fire, and horribly scarred, but survived. Again, arson was never proven. Raine tells Luther that Robey has her daughter and she has to deliver Luther to him.
Meanwhile Raine's team figures out that a "red Room" is being organized on the web. The members get to chose how the victims die. The victims profiles match the people who disappeared all over Europe in the last 6-8 weeks.They visit Robey's ex-wife Georgette (Tara Fitzgerald) (the one who was disfigured in the fire. Luther says he knows Georgette tried to stop Robey which is why he set her on fire), discovering he owns property abroad (She agrees to help after Raine says that Robey had Anya). Archie had set a alert on Raine's passport and informs Robey that she has crossed over into mainland Europe. Robey knows that only Georgette could have directed Raine to Europe.
DS Archie Woodward (Thomas Coombes), Raine's subordinate, is blackmailed by Robey into killing Georgette but is intercepted by Schenk (who was sent by Luther to protect Georgette). Archie commits suicide.Luther and Raine travel to Robey's mansion in rural Norway, where they discover he tortures kidnapped victims on live-stream called "The Red Bunker" for his followers. The two are overpowered, and Robey tries to force them to hurt each other to save Anya. Luther reveals Georgette told the police the location and they are en route.
After a brutal fight, the three are able to escape the bunker, and Luther chases Robey into a frozen lake, where Robey drowns. Luther is rescued by police divers and Schenk. Recovering from his injuries back in London he is approached by Cranfield (Guy Williams), a senior official with MI5, who, it is implied, offers him a job in lieu of going back to prison.</p>

                            <p>Description: On May 9, 2017, Reality Winner watches Fox News coverage on the firing of James Comey by President Donald Trump on the TV at her office. 25 days later, on June 3, Winner returns home from grocery shopping where she is confronted by FBI agents Taylor and Garrick, who explain they have a warrant to search her house and her belongings. As a team of agents arrive and begin searching the house, Winner engages in casual conversation with the agents, all of which is picked up by recording device, the transcript of which forms the basis of the film's dialogue. During the early portion of the recording, Winner expresses concern for her pet dog and cat's safety during the search. Winner agrees to speak with Taylor and Garrick in an empty, disused bedroom in her house. Garrick and Taylor start to question Winner asking about the specifics of her work. She explains, besides working as a yoga instructor and CrossFit trainer, she is a Farsi translator for a government contractor and is hoping to be deployed to Afghanistan as a translator so her fluency in Pashto can be better utilized. The agents eventually reveal they are questioning Winner regarding the recent leak of classified government documents to an online publication. Winner initially denies knowledge, but over the course of an hour is eventually compelled to confess she printed and leaked a document from the National Security Agency's database. The film initially redacts specifics of the leak, as is done in the transcript, but eventually it is revealed that the documents revealed proof of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and the publication was The Intercept, which had put out a call for evidence of Russian interference. Winner denies wishing to be a whistle-blower or undermine the intelligence community à la Edward Snowden, instead expressing she wished for the American public to have the same information the government had regarding the election. As the interrogation wraps up, she chiefly expresses concern for her pets as she realizes she will be taken into custody. She is escorted out of her house and handcuffed, as footage is shown of media reports regarding the leak. Winner receives both praise and criticism for her actions, with some accusing her of colluding with the Middle East or denying the veracity of the leaks altogether. Some outlets criticize The Intercept for allowing the leak to be traced back to Winner, and others theorize that Winner's punishment was designed to discourage potential whistle-blowers. A textual epilogue explains that Winner was denied bail and charged under the Espionage Act. She spent four years in jail and will remain on supervised release until November 2024. It notes that the same document Winner leaked was later used on Senate floor as evidence of Russian interference.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez), his mother, the first female president of the United States, Ellen Claremont (Uma Thurman) attend Prince Phillip's (Thomas Philip) royal wedding. There he meets the groom's brother Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), whom he despises for his snobbish attitude, and in turn, Prince Henry despises Alex for being too animated and irritating. During the reception Alex gets drunk and the two get into a heated argument, after which the wedding cake falls onto them, causing a worldwide media attraction.With the elections on the line, Ellen asks Alex for damage control. She flies her son back to London so Alex and Henry can act like they've been friends their entire lives. During a school visit the pair get stuck in a supply room, it is revealed that Alex can't stand Henry since he perceived the latter as disrespectful. In turn, Henry apologizes and explains that he was going through tough times during his father's death, hence his behavior. Before leaving, Alex invites Prince Henry to his New Year's party, which he originally declines, but after bantering over social media he eventually attends.They hit off at said party, but later a visibly distressed Henry leaves after Alex kisses multiple girls at midnight. Alex then goes after him, where Henry expresses how there's nobody whom he can date. After his monologue he kisses Alex, who then realizes that they both have feelings for each other. Next month, during the President's Dinner they meet each other again, and eventually hook up. They then start a secret intercontinental relationship.After a journalist uncovers Alex's plans to flip Texas, Ellen has an argument with her son. She eventually sends him to Texas so as to carry out said plan. During a New York trip of the campaign, Alex and Henry meet and hook up again in a hotel room. The following morning the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Zahra (Sarah Shahi) discovers their affair, which prompts Alex to come out to his mother.Thanks in partly to her encouragement, he invites Henry to Austin, where he tries to confess his feelings, but Henry - not wanting to break Alex's heart - gets away and flies back to London, to end the connection. An infuriated Alex then flies over, where he has the following proposition: either continue the affair, or end it for good. Henry then takes Alex to statue park over night and confesses; they eventually settle for the first option.Two days later, Henry finds out their private emails are leaked and is forced to suspend all communication with his partner. Alex delivers a speech on the matter, which motivates Zahra to use his connection with Henry's equerry to secure a phone call between the two. Alex then flies over to London, where the king calls for them; him and Phillip explain that their relationship contradicts with the values of the royal crown. However, they get the news protests in their support have broken out all over the UK, including in front of Buckingham palace, whom the couple greet by stepping out on the balcony together. A week later, it is revealed that, thanks to Alex's contributions, Texas was flipped, which confirms Ellen's re-election.</p>

But when Marco is offered a job transfer to Amsterdam, he starts to think about it. Meanwhile, Anna would like to separate, Marco doesn't, but since Tommaso has been promised a trip to the land of the Vikings, they decide to leave in a camper for Norway anyway. Will Marco be able to win back his wife with whom he is still in love? During a magical and unforgettable tour of the lands of the fjords, they will recover their relationship in a natural and unexpected way. Until Anna discovers that Marco kept the job offer in Amsterdam hidden from her.—Canon y mus</p>

                            <p>Description: In the year 2063, Earth has been mostly submerged by rising sea levels, leaving only two small continents in constant conflict with each other. On one of these continents, Last Sentinel's crew, led by Hendrichs, is stationed in a watchtower, armed and waiting for the next attack. Relief was supposed to arrive three months ago, but it has yet to show up. When an empty ship, the Aurora, drifts into view, the commander decides to use its supplies to continue their wait, but the crew is divided on whether to repair the ship and attempt to sail home or stay put. Sullivan and Baines want to escape, while Hendrichs insists on staying put and arming the watchtower's weapons. As tensions rise, a passing ship raises suspicions and Sullivan is sent to investigate, but Hendrichs is quick to consider it a threat and willing to blow it up without hesitation. Amid the chaos, it becomes unclear if the outpost is adrift and if the crew knows where they truly are. Will their fear and mistrust lead to their downfall? Only time will tell.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

                            <p>Description: Paranormal investigator Steve Shippy broke the case seven years ago after more than 40 years of silence. What he found was a living nightmare that rivals horror films like "Amityville Horror" and "Poltergeist," but this house of hell is 100% real and just as terrifying. The story takes place in a farmhouse in the tiny village of Merrill, Michigan. From the summer of 1974 to the spring of 1975, the Pomeraning family endured relentless, bizarre and violent paranormal phenomena. There were knocking, explosions, disembodied voices, even spontaneous combustion that ripped apart the home and the family living inside of it. With dozens of hours of real-time audio recordings, hundreds of police reports and dozens of eyewitnesses, this case is arguably the most well-documented paranormal case in history. Yet to this day, no one knows why this family was ravaged by an unseen, evil force. Was it a poltergeist? Demonic possession? Witchcraft? Now Shippy, along with world-renowned psychic medium Cindy Kaza, armed with new evidence, will finally uncover the source of the evil that terrorized the Michigan Hell House.—Anonymous</p>

                            <p>Description: Not formally trained but nonetheless a talented chef and foodie, Anna is the prep cook on celebrity bad boy chef Dean's successful cooking show. Despite his temperamental and exacting nature, he hired untrained her when he filmed the show once at her parents' diner, where she was the line cook, after firing his last prep cook for changing one of his recipes. When Dean takes the show on the road again, this time to Portugal, he goes missing in action due to the negotiations on his contract renewal stalling. With no other option in needing to continue filming while in Portugal, Hope, the producer, decides to put Anna in front of the camera, she to be the face of the show until Dean returns when they can splice his segments into the footage shot of Anna. Beyond not having the culinary connections as he does, Anna finds that she is not a clone of Dean, she having to find some other way to connect to the show's viewership. Nonetheless, this situation places Anna in a difficult spot regarding Dean, who may not take too kindly to her taking over his show, that is if he does return at all, which if he doesn't means everyone's job. In the process, Anna may find a new path in life as she knows that she doesn't want to be his prep cook for the rest of her life. Her personal life is also put in a tailspin as she makes a mutual connection with Lucas, the manager of the local public market and an aspiring restaurateur, that connection which may not sit too well with Russ, the show's Australian cameraman and her best friend who is seeing Anna in a new light after turning her down when she came on to him once at a work social function.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: The year is 1889, and it has been one year since the notorious "Jack the Ripper" murders terrorized the streets of London. Despite a massive police investigation and intense public interest, the killer's identity remains a mystery. Meanwhile, Sebastian Stubb, a down-on-his-luck newspaper reporter, has moved on to covering other scandals and stories. But when he receives a new "Ripper" letter, claiming responsibility for a new spate of murders, he finds himself drawn back into the case. As Stubb investigates, he must grapple with the possibility that the killer has returned or that a copycat is on the loose. But as he digs deeper, he realizes that the truth may be even stranger than he initially thought. Along the way, Stubb must navigate dangerous alliances and confront the demons of his own past, all while trying to uncover the identity of the killer and bring them to justice.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

Boyd is initially confounded by the nature of the murders and the seemingly ritualistic manner in which they are carried out. As he delves deeper into the case, he realizes that he needs the help of someone with expertise in African culture and customs. Boyd reaches out to Dr. Mackles, an African scholar, for assistance in deciphering the ritualistic elements of the murders. Together, they explore the cultural significance of Muti and its possible connection to the crimes in Clinton. As they work to unravel the mystery, they face resistance from local authorities who are skeptical of their unconventional approach to the case. Boyd and Dr. Mackles must navigate the complexities of cultural differences and overcome their own personal biases to solve the case.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

                            <p>Description: Anlaf, a Viking king from Ireland, arrives with his army in Northumbria after learning that Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons, has fallen gravely ill. Edward soon dies, leaving behind three sons, none of whom were named as his aetheling. Lady Eadgifu and the youngest son Edmund flee to Bebbanburg where Edward's former ally Uhtred resides. Although retired from war, Uhtred is informed that Edward's eldest son Aethelstan will likely attack his younger brother Aelfweard and makes plans to stop him. Before Uhtred leaves, Ingrith prophesies that "seven kings must die" before England is to be united. Uhtred reaches Aegelesburg, where Aelfweard prepares to defend against Aethelstan's impending attack. Aethelstan and his advisor Ingilmundr soon arrive and thwart a trap set by Aelfweard. Uhtred convinces Aelfweard to surrender peacefully, but Aethelstan swiftly kills him and massacres his men. Aethelstan is crowned king of the Saxons and Ingilmundr, who is secretly Aethelstan's lover, urges him to fulfill his grandfather's dream of uniting England and all Christians. In Eoferwic, Aethelstan has taken over following the death of the previous Northumbrian king Rognvaldr and demands that all foreign kings pay him tribute or face conquest and forced baptism. Uhtred arrives and witnesses the destruction of Pagan monuments before learning that King Hywel Dda has submitted to Aethelstan after his son is taken hostage. Uhtred then discovers Aethelstan's relationship with Ingilmundr and believes he's being deceived. Ingilmundr secretly plans to have Uhtred killed, but he's warned by Aldhelm and flees back to Bebbanburg. Aldhelm is subsequently labeled a traitor by Aethelstan and hanged for his actions. Ingilmundr arrives at Bebbanburg to take the castle, but unaware that Uhtred had escaped, he's quickly captured. Ingilmundr later convinces a servant to lure Uhtred into a trap, where he is captured by Aethelstan's men, forcing Osbert to surrender Bebbanburg. Osbert and Edmund are taken captive and sent to Thelwael while Aethelstan, unable to kill Uhtred, banishes him from England. On the Isle of Man, Anlaf hosts a gathering of kings with Prince Domnal and the rulers of Strathclyde, Orkney, Shetland, and Man, warning them of Aethelstan's impending conquest. Although they initially decline the offer of allying with a Pagan, Aethelstan embarks upon an invasion of Scotland, forcing King Constantin and the other rulers to form an alliance. A weakened Uhtred is found by the Danes and taken to Shetland, where he learns that Ingilmundr is a Danish spy and meets with Anlaf and the other kings who request that Uhtred assassinate Aethelstan to avoid war. Uhtred travels to Wintanceaster and unsuccessfully convinces Aethelstan to stop his conquest. Uhtred then returns to Bebbanburg, only to learn from Eadgifu that Anlaf had sacked the castle, and sealed Ingrith and the common-folk in a cave to suffocate. Ingilmundr massacres the Saxons at Thelwael, and Uhtred later arrives to discover that Osbert and Edmund had managed to stay hidden and survive. A remorseful Aethelstan makes peace with Uhtred and plans to stop Anlaf's invasion but refuses any help. Knowing that Aethelstan will likely die, Uhtred and his allies head to face Anlaf, who has amassed his forces at Brunanburh. At the Battle of Brunanburh, Uhtred and Aethelstan's forces are heavily outnumbered and make a tactical withdrawal allowing Saxon cavalry to flank from behind and in the chaos, Domnal and the heirs of the other kings are killed. After witnessing Ingilmundr attack Aethelstan, Uhtred is gravely wounded whilst attempting to aid him. In the aftermath of the battle, the other kings quickly abandon Anlaf and captive Ingilmundr is executed. Aethelstan helps return a mortally wounded Uhtred to Bebbanburg and Finan concludes that the deaths of Edward and the five heirs - five kings who will never be crowned - only partially fulfill the prophecy that "seven kings must die", while Uhtred speculates that he will be the seventh. Uhtred agrees to swear Northumbria to Aethelstan in exchange for him agreeing to make Edmund his sole heir, making Aethelstan the first king of a united England, fulfilling the dream of his grandfather King Alfred. Seemingly on the verge of death, Uhtred experiences a vision of Valhalla where he sees several of his deceased allies waiting for him.</p>

                            <p>Description: In the hit Hollywood movie "Cocaine Bear", a huge bag full of cocaine drops out of the sky into the woods of North Georgia and is eaten by a black bear, who goes on an epic rampage. It all seems like fantasy, but it's actually based on a true story that's just as bizarre as the movie plot, involving drug cartels, murder, mayhem and a Lexington Kentucky blueblood named Drew Thornton. Thornton turns his back on a life of privilege to embrace the dark side, turning from cop to international drug smuggler, flying planeloads of cocaine into America from South America. But one day he mysteriously falls to his death in a Knoxville, Tennessee driveway with his own huge bag of cocaine, armed to the teeth and wearing a pair of...Gucci loafers? How this modern-day Icarus and his fancy shoes have become forever connected to the cocaine bear is the legend behind "Cocaine Bear: The True Story."—Anonymous</p>

She begins stalking Amy's husband Liam and daughter Corinne, and applies for a job as Corinne's live-in nurse under the name Victoria Jones. Catherine uses a fake identity as a former patient named Eleanor to secure the job and sets her sights on replacing her lost family with Liam and Corinne. She wins them over with her charming personality and she even wears Amy's dresses. She poisons Corinne's tea in an attempt to get closer to Liam, but his co-worker Beverly drinks the poisoned tea and confronts Catherine. Catherine drugs Beverly and tries to drive a wedge between Liam and his mother-in-law by planting a pamphlet about child custody. Liam becomes suspicious of Victoria when he realizes that she is not from the agency that sent the other applicants.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

Looking to shake things up for the third, they spontaneously agree to fly to Costa Rica - with COVID lockdowns looming. What's the worst that could happen? Stranded together in a tropical paradise with no idea how they'll get home, the two unwittingly become players in a social experiment that will put their compatibility to the ultimate test. As aspiring vlogger Matt's camera captures everything from bubbly first moments to quarantine cooking, impromptu dance parties, and calamities on the road (not to mention the bugs. So. Many. Bugs), the two try to keep their cool, and leave open the possibility of real connection. Did Matt and Khani decide to YOLO at the worst time possible? Or will their extended time together be just what they need to finally take a chance on love?—Netflix</p>

They prepare for a superstition that they think helps the Pats win, involving Betty stepping on a ladder, Trish reading a magazine in the kitchen, Maura sipping tea, and Lou knocking over a bowl of chips. It works and the Pats win, moving on to the Super Bowl. The ladies cheer for their team and for star quarterback Tom Brady.Trish is known for writing an erotica novel about Rob Gronkowski, as well as being a mascot in ads from her younger days. Betty is great with math and numbers, and she is married to scatterbrained Mark (Bob Balaban). Maura moved into a retirement home after the death of her husband, even though he left their house to her. Lou has been in remission from cancer for 16 years. When the ladies learn from their favorite Pats radio show that there is a contest to attend Super Bowl LI, they decide to enter the contest. Maura gets help from her retirement home friend Mickey (Glynn Turman) to make calls (it is implied he is attracted to Maura), while Lou tries to give a heartfelt story about how she and her friends got into watching football when Brady was a rookie, and it got her through her chemo.Lou announces to her friends that they won the contest and are going to the Super Bowl. The ladies make their preparations, with Betty hiding the truth about her trip to Mark. When they try to pick up Maura, she is fast asleep. Trish distracts the manager Tony (Jimmy O Yang) while Lou and Betty sneak up to Maura's room with help from Mickey and break her out.The ladies arrive in Houston, TX for the big event and stay in their hotel, where they are forced to share two beds. Lou gets a call from her daughter Sara (Sarah Gilbert), who notes that doctors have been trying to reach Lou, but she hasn't answered. She also doesn't tell Sara where she really is.The next day, the ladies head out for the NFL Experience. Lou and Maura get into a football-throwing competition with an employee, and Lou shows she's got an arm on her as she wins several bets with other viewers. Trish does an impromptu reading of her Gronk erotica to a crowd of her fans. She meets retired football player Dan O'Callaghan (Harry Hamlin), who takes an interest in Trish. Betty goes to get food and enters a hot wings contest hosted by Guy Fieri. Betty manages to win the contest despite enduring increasingly spicy sauces. Guy invites the ladies to eat barbecue and later invites them to a big party.That night, the ladies attend the party and get in with Dan's help. A young woman that Betty met outside gives her, Lou, and Maura gummies that they did not know had weed in them. Betty realizes that she left the Super Bowl tickets in her fanny pack (which she innocently calls her "strap-on") at the wings contest. Lou tries to find Guy, while Maura stumbles upon a poker game and enters, proving she has an incredible hand when it comes to cards. Lou finds Trish and Dan hooking up before joining Betty on the dance floor. When Sara calls again, Lou tells her the truth of her whereabouts. Betty accidentally hits a younger man in the face and comforts him. Trish and Lou find Maura winning in an attempt to buy new tickets, but she learns that the winnings go to charities. Lou gets frustrated outside as the ladies try to comfort her.The following morning, the ladies try to return to the NFL Experience to find Betty's fanny pack, but it's closed. They split up to try and find help. Trish comes across Nat and Pat (Alex Moffat and Rob Corddry), the hosts of the radio show they listen to, and she learns that the actual winners of the contest were a group of four guys called the Tom Brady Support Group since each of them are actually named Tom Brady and feel pressure of living up to QB Brady's name. Maura attempts to get them off a scalper, but he is asking for way too much. Betty ends up running into Guy, and he returns her the fanny pack.When the ladies try to get into the stadium, the head security guard, Chip (Ron Funches), tells them that the tickets they got were fake and that they have been scammed. Lou comes clean to her friends that she bought them online because she fears that this may be the last chance she will have to do something unforgettable, revealing to them that she is afraid to open a letter from the doctors since it could mean her cancer has come back. Lou's friends stick by her side and try to find an alternate way in.The ladies spot Gugu (Billy Porter), a friend that Maura made during the poker game. He agrees to help them get in by posing as his dancers. The four join Gugu and his actual dancers in a little presentation, which impresses the security guard enough to let them pass. The friends get excited as they take their seats. Dan keeps texting Trish, but she tells Betty that she is going to ghost him since she doesn't want to rush into another relationship like with her last husband that cheated on her. Chip spots the ladies when they are featured on the jumbotron, but as he is escorting them out, Dan invites them up to his hospitality box. Trish explains herself to Dan about not wanting to jump so fast into a relationship, but he agrees to take things slow with her.The game starts off poorly with the Pats getting beat by the Atlanta Falcons. The ladies make their way into the coaches booth and work the controls so that Lou can contact Brady through his helmet. She gives him a little speech about how he inspired her when she was going through chemo, and it is enough to encourage Brady to lead the Pats to make a comeback. The Pats play harder and end the game as champions.Maura tells the ladies that she made a bet with a rich jerk who bet against the Pats, and she won some good money. She also speaks to Mickey, telling him to let the staff at the retirement home know she is going to leave and move back into her own house, and she invites Mickey to visit her. Chip finds the ladies and appears to be kicking them out, but he guides them to the locker room to meet the Pats themselves. Betty praises Danny Amendola for his catch record, Maura admires Julian Edelman's beard, Trish gets to meet Gronk, who happens to be a fan of her book, and Lou meets Brady, who thanks her for inspiring him. He also admires her "80 For Brady" jersey and asks if he can swap his jersey for hers, which Lou agrees to.In a jump to the year 2020. Sara joins Betty, Trish, and Maura for the next Super Bowl game. It appears as though Lou has died when Trish begins to toast her, but she emerges alive and healthy. The ladies then gather for another epic game.Before the credits roll, the four friends are sitting by the beach with Brady as Maura asks him if he has considered retirement. Brady responds that it's hard to think about retirement "when you've still got it", which the four agree too. Finally, there is a text that states the film was inspired by a true story, featuring a picture of the actual four best friends.</p>

                            <p>Description: Not formally trained but nonetheless a talented chef and foodie, Anna is the prep cook on celebrity bad boy chef Dean's successful cooking show. Despite his temperamental and exacting nature, he hired untrained her when he filmed the show once at her parents' diner, where she was the line cook, after firing his last prep cook for changing one of his recipes. When Dean takes the show on the road again, this time to Portugal, he goes missing in action due to the negotiations on his contract renewal stalling. With no other option in needing to continue filming while in Portugal, Hope, the producer, decides to put Anna in front of the camera, she to be the face of the show until Dean returns when they can splice his segments into the footage shot of Anna. Beyond not having the culinary connections as he does, Anna finds that she is not a clone of Dean, she having to find some other way to connect to the show's viewership. Nonetheless, this situation places Anna in a difficult spot regarding Dean, who may not take too kindly to her taking over his show, that is if he does return at all, which if he doesn't means everyone's job. In the process, Anna may find a new path in life as she knows that she doesn't want to be his prep cook for the rest of her life. Her personal life is also put in a tailspin as she makes a mutual connection with Lucas, the manager of the local public market and an aspiring restaurateur, that connection which may not sit too well with Russ, the show's Australian cameraman and her best friend who is seeing Anna in a new light after turning her down when she came on to him once at a work social function.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Paranormal investigator Steve Shippy broke the case seven years ago after more than 40 years of silence. What he found was a living nightmare that rivals horror films like "Amityville Horror" and "Poltergeist," but this house of hell is 100% real and just as terrifying. The story takes place in a farmhouse in the tiny village of Merrill, Michigan. From the summer of 1974 to the spring of 1975, the Pomeraning family endured relentless, bizarre and violent paranormal phenomena. There were knocking, explosions, disembodied voices, even spontaneous combustion that ripped apart the home and the family living inside of it. With dozens of hours of real-time audio recordings, hundreds of police reports and dozens of eyewitnesses, this case is arguably the most well-documented paranormal case in history. Yet to this day, no one knows why this family was ravaged by an unseen, evil force. Was it a poltergeist? Demonic possession? Witchcraft? Now Shippy, along with world-renowned psychic medium Cindy Kaza, armed with new evidence, will finally uncover the source of the evil that terrorized the Michigan Hell House.—Anonymous</p>

                            <p>Description: In the year 2063, Earth has been mostly submerged by rising sea levels, leaving only two small continents in constant conflict with each other. On one of these continents, Last Sentinel's crew, led by Hendrichs, is stationed in a watchtower, armed and waiting for the next attack. Relief was supposed to arrive three months ago, but it has yet to show up. When an empty ship, the Aurora, drifts into view, the commander decides to use its supplies to continue their wait, but the crew is divided on whether to repair the ship and attempt to sail home or stay put. Sullivan and Baines want to escape, while Hendrichs insists on staying put and arming the watchtower's weapons. As tensions rise, a passing ship raises suspicions and Sullivan is sent to investigate, but Hendrichs is quick to consider it a threat and willing to blow it up without hesitation. Amid the chaos, it becomes unclear if the outpost is adrift and if the crew knows where they truly are. Will their fear and mistrust lead to their downfall? Only time will tell.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

                            <p>Description: Ben and his wife Jules are in for a surprise when they inherit an abandoned coastal property that Ben's recently deceased mother never told them about. Untouched for 40 years the house looms like an eerie relic over land which includes a stunning private cove and beach. The beauty and tranquility of the place leave the family with the nagging question: why was this property kept a secret for so long? While Jules rummages through the house looking for answers, Ben goes to repair the buried water tank, not knowing that in doing so he is unleashing a long-dormant creature, fiercely protective of its environment.—Mahou 5 star</p>

From the depths of Supercity Europe's underworld to the forgotten military installations of the arctic circle, Harrington and Cass are pitted against shadowy forces, clone troopers and masked assassins as they fight to stop the mysterious 'Project: Centurion', once and for all.</p>

The Lakers were outplayed by the talented and inventive Black Globetrotters, with Sweetwater Clifton impressing the crowd with his graceful athleticism. Lapchick and Irish took the lead in advocating for the integration of the team, with the support of NBA President Maurice Podoloff. They worked with other team owners in the league to create a groundbreaking moment in history.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

                            <p>Description: 25th September 1915, British forces launched a major attack on the German position at Loos, France, hence commencing the Battle of Loos. Kulbir Thapa, a 26 yrs old Rifleman in the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles, was in one of the leading companies venturing deep into German lines, and it was the first time he had been under fire and short-lived hope of survival was all gone when he was severely wounded. A survival story behind the enemy line itself is a praiseworthy tale of bravery but his story didn't finish there. What unfolds next is a legendary tale of self-sacrifice, compassion and friendship. The next day, on 26th September, for a fleeting moment, midst burnt and grime filled no man's land, he displayed much greater heroism than war- humanity.

Panicked, Rory pulls the B&B's future owner, Noah, onto her arm and pretends he is her new boyfriend. Noah has problems of his own. The B&B is failing, and his father is ready to sell. To save his family legacy, Noah has invited big-time travel blogger Penny Traverse to review the place, but he's not ready. With her PR background, Rory suggests she help them prepare in exchange for Noah acting as her fake boyfriend. Rory and Noah work together to ready the B&B and between this fake couple, real sparks begin to fly.—Happy_Evil_Dude</p>

Olivia's best friend Katie convinces her to take a trip to the tropical Haven Isles in the hope of reinspiring her. On the other side of the world, Prince Alexander is reminded by the Queen of his upcoming duty to marry royalty. Needing some distance, Prince Alexander decides to attend a wildlife rescue gala on Haven Isles. On arriving at the island, the Prince and Olivia meet and a friendship is formed, but Alexander keeps his identity a secret. Experiencing all the Island has to offer, Olivia and Alexander grow closer, until the Prince's true identity is exposed by a royal spy. Stunned, but willing to accept his apology, Olivia agrees to accompany Alexander to the gala where the Queen appears, and tells Olivia there is no future with her son. Upset, Olivia returns to New York. The publishers love her new story but demand a happier ending. Olivia refuses, until Alexander appears, pledging his love, and Olivia decides to give the happy ending another try.—Happy_Evil_Dude</p>

                            <p>Description: On October 25, 1979, all hell broke loose at the Miami Aerospace Academy (MAA) when the school's student body seemed to fall victim to a mass demonic possession. Terrifying reports of what occurred at the high school spread like wildfire: one girl claimed the devil was inside her and was seen levitating, a boy seemed to display superhuman strength and a full-on riot broke out as students ripped doors off of hinges and smashed windows. Forty years later, former MAA students, as well as law enforcement, psychologists, paranormal investigators and demonologists, come together to explain what happened that fateful day the devil took over the school.—Anonymous</p>

                            <p>Description: The Nazi evolution from murderous anti-semitism into organised death camps, as documented in this sober piece of historical excavation from Holocaust specialist James Bulgin, is truly shocking in its specificity. An ad-hoc interpretation of party doctrine became an agreed policy of mass shootings on the Eastern Front, before logistical frustrations and concern for the mental health of the executioners prompted a shift to more efficient methods. Almost as distressing as the barbarism itself was the necessary collaboration and complicity of many thousands of locals across Latvia and Lithuania. Harrowing viewing, but it is surely only in better understanding the detail behind the Nazis' mass murders that we can better understand how to ensure it never happens again.—from BBC (Canon y mus)</p>

                            <p>Description: Cousins Teresa and Jessica, and Jessica's new boyfriend Caleb, are vacationing at a lakeside cabin when a seemingly ill Jessica scalps Teresa and decapitates Caleb before levitating above the lake. One day earlier, upset at learning she is pregnant, guitar technician Beth visits her sister Ellie, a tattoo artist and single mother to teenagers Danny and Bridget, and child Kassie, in their home at Monde Apartments, a condemned Los Angeles apartment complex. The building is shaken by an earthquake while the children are in its basement parking lot, uncovering a concealed chamber. Danny investigates it, discovering religious artifacts, three phonograph records from 1923, and a strange book that he takes up to his room, believing he could possibly sell it and use the money to help Ellie. The initial record details rejected efforts by a priest to research the book, revealed to be one of three volumes of the Naturom Demonto. The subsequent record reveals the priest continued his research in secret and recites an incantation that summons demonic entities known as Deadites. The building's power fails, and an isolated Ellie is attacked and possessed by an unseen force. She returns to the apartment in a trance, menacingly threatens her family, and dies after pleading with Beth to protect her children. Beth and Ellie's neighbors help lay her to rest in her bedroom and search for a way out. They find that the staircase has collapsed, the elevator is damaged, and they are unable to access the fire escape before Ellie revives and attacks the family, wounding Bridget. Beth and the children lock Ellie outside the apartment after she pursues and massacres the neighbors. Danny confesses to Beth about recovering the Naturom Demonto, and Ellie tricks Kassie into unlocking the door before attacking her. While Danny and Beth are distracted rescuing Kassie and locking Ellie out, Bridget becomes possessed via her wound. Bridget attacks Beth before turning on Danny and Kassie, who inadvertently impales her through the head with a broken broom handle. Beth listens to the third record to understand how to exorcise the Deadites, but learns the priest failed and his allies were all possessed, with only complete destruction of the host stopping the Deadites. Bridget revives and fatally stabs Danny, who sets Bridget on fire before dying as Ellie infiltrates the apartment using the vents. Realizing Beth is pregnant, Ellie attempts to rip the fetus out of her, but Beth and Kassie are able to incapacitate her with scissors. Ellie fails to emotionally manipulate Kassie who accepts that her mother is already gone. Danny and the bodies of the neighbors are possessed, leading Beth and Kassie to take shelter in the damaged elevator. Ellie, Bridget, and Danny merge into a multi-limbed creature known as the Marauder and climb atop the elevator to attack the pair as the machine fills with blood. The combined weight causes the elevator to plummet to the ground floor, allowing Beth and Kassie to flee into the parking lot. The Marauder captures Kassie and attempts to behead her with a chainsaw, but Beth returns and distracts it, and she and Kassie destroy the Marauder's body by forcing it into a wood chipper. Ellie's decapitated head taunts Beth, saying she will be a failure as a mother, prompting her to kick Ellie's head into the chipper. Beth and Kassie escape the building together. The next morning, Jessica goes to the parking lot to leave for her vacation, where she is attacked by an unseen force.</p>

                            <p>Description: GOOD OL GIRL follows three young Texas cowgirls tasked with carrying on their families' legacies amidst a volatile landscape and industry. The film explores the modern West: a place where the male cowboy mythology must answer to a new, honest, and some would say subversive, female story. The jarring transition between generations illuminates the weight of heritage and tradition. As the old guard wanes, these three women stand amidst the vast ranchlands of Texas. Who has the authority to claim our traditions when only those who have been overlooked are left to carry them on?</p>

When the only solace is their mother's chocolate cake, they decide to create a chocolate cake that makes you lose weight. But, during the funding 'pitch' party, the investor's dog gets into the chocolate cake which sets off a 24-hour city-wide chase beginning with Dr. Dogwood, the eccentric vet with a 'potion', an encounter with a bumbling terrorist, and the attention of an up and coming field reporter who sees this as her shot at fame. The topper is when they realize they have gained the interest of the mob boss Carmine Frangiolini and his opportunistic family friend, Lucas Morello, who "want to make them an offer they cannot refuse". Somehow, through this ordeal, these two displaced sisters come together to create a national franchise and find that... they aren't so different after all.—Jody Mortara</p>

At that time, pop music fans in the UK were unlikely to hear black music on mainstream radio, and names like Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson still meant nothing to most British people. But thousands of miles away from where these exciting new sounds were being recorded in Detroit, a small group of dedicated British music fans had stumbled across the songs and began championing its artists.—BBC2</p>

                            <p>Description: BANKRUPT BILLIONAIRE is the story of Sean Quinn, the man who personified Ireland's boom and subsequently, its bust.With unprecedented access to Quinn himself, filmed over a four-year period, telling one of the most extraordinary stories of our time; a reversal of fortunes more far-fetched than fiction. It is the story of how a farmer's son from Derrylin went from being a school dropout to one of the richest men in the world - literally building an empire from the limestone and shale-filled ground he grew up on. Charting the dramatic expansion of the Quinn empire, from manufacturing to hospitality, property and insurance, we detail how Sean Quinn became a 'chieftain' to his native region on the Fermanagh / Cavan border; injecting wealth and hope into a community which remains fiercely loyal to him today.Detailing the awe-inspiring rags to riches story of Sean Quinn's success, the film builds to the dramatic tipping point - the bursting of his billionaire bubble and spectacular downfall. Forensically unpicking the boom to bust years; it charts the story of how a billionaire became a bankrupt prisoner, brought down by the collapse of his insurance business and a multi-billion-euro gamble on shares in the Anglo Irish Bank. Punctuated by dark moments of introspection from Quinn himself, on the last ten years of his life.Featuring candid testimony from Sean Quinn, building a picture of an enigmatic, fascinating and divisive character; someone who amassed an unimaginable fortune and all the trimmings but remained firmly rooted; his desire for wealth matched by his desire for the simple things in life. It was this deep-seated attachment to home which arguably led to his downfall - choosing to invest in a local bank, which happened to be the most toxic in the world.Charting a 40-year career of staggering highs and lows, the documentary brings Sean Quinn's story up to date, detailing the latest dramas in a gripping saga; the ongoing legal battles between the Quinn family and the former Anglo Irish Bank, the toxic relationship between Quinn and his former business associates and the current campaign of intimidation against managers running companies formerly owned by Quinn, culminating in the horrific attack in 2019 on former right-hand man, Kevin Lunney.</p>

                            <p>Description: Tara has long known, even back to that New Year's Eve party ten years ago, that having a man in her life is not only not important, but that relationships only lead to problems as was the case with her parents, her father who long ago left the family leaving her mother, Nadine, devastated. Despite that devastation, Nadine has always pushed Tara toward being in a committed relationship, Tara in turn sending her mother an occasional selfie with a man, such as her internet date that New Year's Eve who she connected with solely for that selfie, to keep her off her back. This Christmas season, Tara decides that what she will do for the new year is to focus on herself and her music career, meaning no men, period. As such, she invites the love club to join her for New Years Eve to celebrate ringing in what she is calling the Year of Tara. Nicole, the romantic in planning the event for Tara, turns at least the invitations to the other guests into a marriage ceremony i.e. Tara marrying herself. The problem is is that Nadine gets wind of Tara getting "married", which leads to a series of complications. Tara's latest selfie partner, Noah Bailey, a songwriter/musician she hired to perform in the lounge and who came to town solely in the possibility of meeting music promoter Garth Bryant in, similar to Tara, trying to nail down that elusive record deal, is initially a willing partner in pretending to be Tara's fiancé for Nadine, who is half way across the country. But as those complications pile up, the closer it gets to Tara and Noah necessarily getting to a real altar solely to hide the lies from Nadine. These complications are only exacerbated by the two actually starting to fall for each other, which they may not be able to admit to either themselves, each other, or Tara to the love club, especially as they both may see it competing with their respective music careers.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: In the early 20th century, Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula met English lawyer R. M. Renfield, who was hoping to broker a deal for some land but ended up becoming Dracula's familiar.For decades, Renfield has relied on supernatural powers that are initiated by eating bugs. Dracula has recently had a close call with some vampire hunters who almost killed him, so the duo move to New Orleans to recuperate. There, Renfield discovers a 12-step self-help group for persons in co-dependent relationships, and he plans to use the crowd there to hunt out abusive lovers whom he can kill and give to Dracula to feast on without feeling remorse. He follows a narcissistic boyfriend to a warehouse with stolen drugs, and as he batters some lower-level criminals, they are all attacked by an assassin hired by the Lobo crime family who are pushing drugs into the city.Renfield kills the assassin and attempts to hunt down the man who hired him, Teddy Lobo, but Teddy drives off in a hurry, and a weakened Renfield drags the corpses back to Dracula's lair in the basement of a dilapidated hospital. Lobo runs into a sobriety checkpoint that is run by Rebecca Quincy, a second-generation police officer who sees the opportunity to take a high-level criminal off the streets and arrests Teddy after he speeds through the checkpoint and hurls bricks of cocaine at the police. At the police station, Teddy easily gets out of custody since the feds cooperate with the Lobos. Meanwhile, Quincy has a confrontation with her sister Kate, who has also dedicated herself to police work but is gathering a large-scale case with the FBI, frustrating Rebecca, who wants answers and justice immediately.Dracula tells Renfield that the criminals he has brought as food are insufficient, and the vampire desires the blood of someone pure and innocent instead. Renfield goes to a restaurant to abduct commoners while Quincy is also led there with clues at the crime scene. The two are caught in an attack on Quincy's life that Teddy has been pressured into making so that the fierce reputation of the Lobos will be reestablished. Instead, Renfield and Quincy defend themselves, killing several gang members and leading Teddy to escape.Teddy's mother, Bellafrancesca, orders him to hunt down the man who killed her foot soldiers, and he ends up encountering Dracula when Renfield is away. The two agree to form an alliance while Renfield has taken to heart the teachings of his self-help group and decides to make a life for himself apart from his master. Setting up an apartment and changing his attitude to one of helpfulness, he gives a statement to the police to help them try to finally stop the Lobo Crime Family. Dracula learns of Renfield's betrayal and slaughters the support group members in front of his former minion.Quincy appears and finds Renfield surrounded by dead bodies, causing her to arrest him until she is immediately swarmed by police officers and the Lobos, who also want revenge on Renfield. Quincy refuses to hand him over, and she barely escapes with Renfield. Quincy wakes up the next morning to find that Renfield has saved her life, and he explains his true origin while confirming that he wants to reform himself. The two fight through a group of corrupt police officers and decide to storm the Lobos headquarters, only to find that Dracula has empowered over a half-dozen gang members to have all of Renfield's supernatural abilities, including Teddy. After a fight, Renfield kills Teddy.Quincy heads to stop Dracula and finds that her sister is beaten to near-death and only the healing properties of Dracula's blood can save her, which he will offer in exchange for Rebecca's loyalty. She tricks Dracula, leading to him having a final standoff with Renfield and Quincy that ends with the two collaborating to capture him in a magical circle.Renfield and Quincy beat Dracula into pieces, capture loads of his healing blood, and divide up the bits of his corpse into pieces of concrete that they scatter across the water system, either finally destroying the vampire or at least making it very hard for him to reform his body. Renfield later resurrects his self-help group friends with him feeling empowered to make a new life for himself.</p>

                            <p>Description: Prior to imprisonment, bard Edgin Darvis (Chris Pine) served in the Harpers, an order of peacekeepers (sworn to defend the oppressed and fight tyranny), until his wife Zia (Georgia Landers) was killed by disciples of a Red Wizard he had arrested.
With Zia's death, Edgin abandoned his oath. Edgin took to drinking heavily and that's when he met Holga. Holga was a resident of Rock Bottom and was cast aside by her tribe for falling in love with an outsider. Holga took pity on Edgin and took him and Kira in. She saw Edgin like a brother.
Holga and Edgin turned to theft to fund their survival. Kira grew up in this atmosphere.Accompanied by barbarian Holga Kilgore (Michelle Rodriguez), Edgin attempted to make a new life for himself and his daughter Kira (Chloe Coleman) by turning to theft, teaming with amateur sorcerer Simon Aumar (Justice Smith) (a half-elf wild magic sorcerer who is the descendant of Elminster Aumar, a notable wizard), rogue con artist Forge Fitzwilliam (Hugh Grant), and Forge's mysterious acquaintance Sofina (Daisy Head).
While raiding a Harper stronghold, Edgin attempted to steal a "Tablet of Reawakening" to resurrect his wife, but he and Holga were captured while their accomplices escaped. Simon was unable to stop Sofina's magic, which was too powerful for him.
Edgin entrusted the Tablet to Forge and asked him to keep Kira safe.After two years' imprisonment in arctic Revel's End, the pair, unaware they have been pardoned, escape to Neverwinter and learn Forge has become Lord there after its prior lord fell mysteriously incapacitated. Forge has been taking care of Kira, convincing her that Edgin's selfish greed led to his arrest. It is revealed that Sofina is a Red Wizard and together they orchestrated Edgin and Holga's capture.
Forge had told Kira that Edgin was after the Tablet of Riches, but Edgin clarifies that it was the Tablet of Reawakening. Forge refuses to hand over the Tablet to Edgin. Kira does not believe Edgin.Sofina attempts to execute Edgin and Holga, but they escape and decide to rob Forge's vault and bring Kira home during the upcoming High Sun Games, needing the tablet to prove their innocence to Kira and resurrect Edgin's wife.
Forge tells Kira that he gave the Tablet of Riches to Edgin and he left.The gladiatorial games had been banned, but Forge re-instituted them, promising that the games would bring tourists and money. Edgin and Holga track down Simon to help; he suggests also recruiting Doric (Sophia Lillis) (a Tiefling druid raised in the Neverwinter Wood by a wood elf enclave), a druid whose forest community is fighting forced logging ordered by Forge.
Doric agrees to help Edgin as there is no one else willing to stand up to Forge.Shapeshifted into a fly, Doric infiltrates Forge's castle, finding the vault has magical defenses from Mordenkainen, which Simon cannot disable. Simon believes a magic relic, "The Helm of Disjunction," could disable them. It's a helmet that disables all nearby enchantments. The Helm went missing ages ago.
They travel to an old graveyard to ask Holga's ancestors where to find it. Simon resurrects the dead with a talisman long enough for them to answer five questions each.
The corpses reveal they gave the Helm to Xenk Yandar (Regé-Jean Page) (a paladin who narrowly escaped Szass Tam's "rise to power" in Thay and as a result, "ages more slowly than a normal human"), a paladin who fled his country, Thay, when Szass Tam (Ian Hanmore) (a powerful Red Wizard and the ruler of Thay) turned Thayans into an Undead army. Not being asked enough questions, one corpse is left "alive".Xenk agrees to help the group when he realizes that Forge has made an alliance with the Red Wizard. He suspects that Tam is up to something. Currently, Tam's powers do not extend beyond Thay and that is what he wants to change.
After forcing Edgin to swear to distribute any gained bounty to the people, Xenk guides the group through the Underdark to retrieve the Helm. With the help of a teleportation staff obtained from Holga's half-ling ex-husband, they find the relic but are attacked by Thayan assassins sent by Sofina. Xenk fights off the assassins and helps the group escape from the obese red dragon Themberchaud before departing.Simon has trouble mastering the Helm's power as the Helm refuses to allow Simon to wield its power. Simon blames Edgin as he says that he told Edgin that this plan is not going to work. The group loses their morale, and everyone wants to quit. Edgin narrates that he stole Red Wizard's treasure and didn't know that they marked it. He led the Red Wizards right to his own doorstep and his family paid the price for it. Edgin says that he cannot quit.
They decide to use the staff to enter the vault during the games. But the portal opens into a stone wall and Doric tries to dig a hole into the wall to get through as a worm. Edgin decides to enter the vault through the front door and attacks the castle with Holga and Simon. Simon gets to the door of the vault and successfully attunes with the helmet to open the magically sealed door.Simon and Holga infiltrate the magically sealed door but find the room empty except for a magical trap. Doric infiltrates the location where the treasure is stored, and it is under the arena.
Sofina, disguised as Kira, subdues Edgin.
The group is captured and forced to participate in the games but manages to escape the stadium. Doric discovers Forge has loaded the treasure onto a boat and is preparing to flee. The group cannot figure out what Sofina gets out of the deal, if Forge is escaping with all the loot.
The group steals the boat for themselves and rescues Kira from Forge, who threatened Kira's life.As they escape, the group realize Sofina organized the games to draw a massive crowd and turn them into an Undead army using the same curse that destroyed Thay. The group returns, transporting Forge's stolen riches out of the boat with the teleportation staff and spreading them across the city by hot-air balloon, drawing people out of the stadium before Sofina's spell takes effect.Enraged at her defeat, Sofina attacks the group, but Simon manages to master his magic and nullify Sofina's time-stop spell, allowing Kira to use an invisibility pendant Edgin and Holga gave her as a child to place an anti-magic bracelet on Sofina. Sofina is killed when attacked by Doric in owl-bear form and then crushed by falling debris, but Holga is fatally injured. Edgin uses the tablet to bring her back to life, accepting that he wanted to bring back his wife only for his own sake while Holga had become a true part of their family. Doric signals openness to a relationship with Simon.Restored, the old Lord of Neverwinter declares the team heroes of the realm. Xenk sends Forge to Revel's End, where he spectacularly fails to escape as Edgin and Holga did when his pardon was denied.</p>

                            <p>Description: Father Gabriele Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist, and an earthy, humorous, practical man at times, arrives at a small village in Italy where a man is allegedly possessed by a spirit. Along with the local priest he enters the room where the man was tied up. While exorcising the man, he refers to the spirit as Satan and sends it into a pig which was brought in for the exorcism. As soon as the spirit enters the pig, Amorth shoots it with a shotgun.This incident gets him in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors. One tribunal member is a friendly African bishop, Lumumba, but one is a vicious American cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of exorcism and even demonic possession. Amorth replies that evil does exist, and that he did not perform an exorcism, but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally-disturbed man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.After this, the Pope assigns him to visit a possessed little boy named Henry in Spain. Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy travel to Spain from America to take possession of a mysterious old abbey which was Henry's father's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident, with Henry also present. The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident. Workmen, who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave after a sinister fire. Henry starts behaving bizarrely; brain tests show nothing abnormal.Henry, satanically possessed, asks for a priest; the local Father Esquibel arrives, but Henry abuses him and says, "Wrong priest." Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel says he has heard of Amorth, but hasn't read his books; Amorth says, "They're good books." Esquibel makes mistakes as a junior exorcist at first, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him.The duo make various attempts to exorcise Henry, without success. Henry's demon even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood, but he convinces her to pray.In Rome, the Pope is taken sick while reading documents about the Spanish case, and is hospitalized. Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous. He finds that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition was possessed while being an exorcist, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils, including the Inquisition. Amorth also finds the Church covered this up, and eventually finds the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism.Amorth and Esquibel reveal to each other their own, and absolve each other's, sins or traumas: that Amorth has guilt from surviving World War II as an Italian partisan, and that a mentally-ill woman asked Amorth's help, and committed suicide when he did not help her enough; and Esquibel had extramarital intercourse with young women. While this helps them bond, they are still unable to exorcise Henry, and they have horrible visions of the women with whom they failed; the exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Henry's previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church. However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon, and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled Amorth and Esquibel. The Pope recovers, as does Henry.The triumphant duo visit Rome, and find the skeptical American bishop has taken leave in Guam, and been replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive of mysterious events; Lumumba tells them they will be helping go to hundreds of other evil sites, with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to combat the Devil. Amorth joyfully says, "We're going to Hell!" Finally, words on the screen narrate biographical details about Amorth's papal-exorcist career, including that he has written many books, and "The books are good."An after-credits photo of the real Amorth sticking out his tongue appears, along with his birth and death dates.</p>

                            <p>Description: They have no roots, no seeds, no flowers, but mosses show immense survival capacities and can suspend their biological activity for long periods. Today, researchers are exploring the exceptional resistance of these archaic organisms. British ecologists have even resurrected a "zombie" moss that has been trapped in the permafrost for 1,500 years. Associated with decay and disliked in Europe, mosses are deified in Japan. With 25,000 species worldwide, bryophytes - their scientific name - are the seat of real ecosystems, and can develop in inhospitable landscapes, through an extravagant reproduction cycle.</p>

                            <p>Description: Set in present day New Delhi, Gulmohar tracks the final four days, leading up to Holi, of the Batra family as they pack their belongings to move out of their thirty-four year old family home. Amid the chaos of packing up the house, the film interweaves individual story-lines of various members of this house, who are recognizable characters to most of us, and portrays their interpersonal relationships, as we unfold secrets of the past, tensions of the present and uncertainties of the future. In current testing times, Gulmohar serves as a love song to the times that we are living in today and creating for tomorrow and explores the meaning of family and home - the only two things that have always mattered, more so now than ever.—Aayushi</p>

                            <p>Description: Danny Rourke, an Austin Police Department detective, recalls to his therapist the abduction of his seven-year-old daughter, Minnie, which led to the dissolution of his marriage. Afterwards, he is picked up by his partner, Nicks, who informs him they have received an anonymous tip-off call that a safe deposit box at a bank will be robbed. At the stakeout, they witness a mysterious man give unheard instructions to civilians, bank employees, and fellow policemen, who seemingly follow his commands as he enters the bank. Rourke races to the targeted safe deposit box, finding inside it a picture of Minnie with the message "Find Lev Dellrayne" written on it. Rourke pursues the man to a rooftop, where he witnesses him command two police officers to shoot each other as he escapes. Convinced the heist has something to do with the disappearance of his daughter, Rourke investigates. Trace run by Nicks on the tip-off call leads Rourke to the address of fortune-teller Diana Cruz. After he describes to her the man from the bank heist, a client of Cruz's, under the control of that man, drives a motorcycle through Cruz's window before killing himself. Rourke takes Cruz into protective custody. She explains that the mysterious man from the bank is named "Lev Dellrayne" and that he and Cruz are both the escaped "Hypnotics": powerful hypnotists trained by a secretive government "Division" to control people's minds. Rourke is mysteriously immune to such mind control when Cruz tries to exercise it on him. Meanwhile, Dellrayne outside the police station commands Nicks to attack Rourke and Cruz, and Cruz then shoots him dead in self-defense. Rourke and Cruz flee to Mexico. There, they learn from a former Division contact Jeremiah that Dellrayne is seeking "Domino", a powerful weapon developed by the Division, stolen, and hidden by Dellrayne when he escaped. Dellrayne then wiped his own memory and left behind "triggers" prompting him to gradually recall Domino's location and regain his own hypnotic power. Dellrayne eventually reveals himself to be Jeremiah in disguise and pursues Rourke and Cruz through a hypnotically constructed environment before Rourke taps into his own previously unknown hypnotic power, allowing them to escape. Rourke and Cruz seek out River, a reclusive Division hacker, who discovers Rourke's wife, Vivian, in Division's database. Later, Rourke investigates River's database himself, and discovers that Minnie is Domino, the daughter of two powerful hypnotics: Rourke and Cruz (who is revealed to be Vivian). As "Cruz" interrupts him, Rourke realizes that the room and all of the events up to this point have been hypnotic constructs. He wakes up in a large room populated by Division agents, all of whom he has seen throughout the constructed story, including Nicks and "Dellrayne." Vivian and "Dellrayne" explain that Rourke and Vivian are both hypnotics, and their daughter Minnie was born and raised within the Division, but that he escaped with her to stop her from becoming their weapon. Hiding her and then wiping his memory, Rourke no longer remembers where she is, and the Division has been putting him through constructs of the search for her to make him remember. Rourke is plugged back into the construct, where he repeats the session with his therapist and the stakeout at the bank heist. However, Rourke soon escapes using his own powers and flees as the Division realizes that "Find Lev Dellrayne" refers not to a person but "Deer Valley Lane": the location of a ranch where Rourke's foster parents have been hiding Minnie. Rourke arrives at the ranch and is reunited with Minnie, who is now aged three years and is in full control of her hypnotic powers. The Division surrounds the ranch, but it is all revealed to be another construct of Minnie's creation. Minnie restores Vivian's memories that she was involved in Rourke and Minnie's escape and that her memory was subsequently wiped so that when Minnie would be powerful enough to defeat the entire Division at once, Vivian could unwittingly lead them to her. Minnie forces the Division agents to kill each other, and she, her parents, and Rourke's foster parents celebrate their new-found freedom. In a mid-credits' scene, "Dellrayne" is revealed to have survived the shoot-out, having constructed Rourke's foster-father to look like him during the fight with Minnie.</p>

                            <p>Language: en</p>
                            <p>Description: During the COVID outbreak, Pamela returned to her parent's house on Vancouver Island. She had always known that she would return to the island to take care of her parents in their old age. Over the years, she had mailed everything that she believed she would one day want to look back at to her family house. In "Pamela: A Love Story," she revisits the journals and video recordings, bringing back bittersweet memories. We learn that Pamela had always had a knack for words and could be her honest self when she wrote down her feelings. From the jitters she experienced while traveling to LA for the first time to the hopelessness she often encountered when it came to finding love, she archived it all.Pamela's childhood was spent watching her parents' fight. Her mom was a waitress, and her dad was a poker player. Her dad drank a lot.
They were young parents figuring out their lives, and the responsibility often overwhelmed them. They even left their father a couple of times and lived on welfare.
Pamela was abused as a child by her babysitter. Even though Pamela knew how wrong it was, she chose never to mention it to her mother. She knew her mother was struggling with her own life, and she did not wish to burden her. The abuse continued for three to four years, during which time she protected her brother from the babysitter and attempted to kill her once. She hoped for her death that day, and the next day, the babysitter died in a car accident. For a long time, she lived with the guilt of killing her babysitter in her mind.
The fact that, as a child, she felt she would be a burden if she shared something that bothered her spoke volumes about the insecurity she lived with. At the age of 12, she was sexually assaulted by an older man. She had grown up to hate her body as a result of being violated several times. She hated the fact that all her life, she had been attracted to emotionally unavailable men.After graduating from high school, she went to Vancouver in 1989. Her girlfriends were Labatt's beer representatives; they received free tickets for a football game, and they invited Pamela to it. She was wearing Labatt's beer t-shirts, and the cameraman at the event zoomed in on her and put her on the jumbo-tron. Labatt's eventually reached out to her to work on a commercial for them.
The commercial introduced her to the world, and she was contacted by the photo editor of Playboy magazine, Marilyn Grabowski. Pamela initially struggled to believe that she had indeed been contacted by Playboy to pose for their magazine cover. As a girl who grew up on an island, it was unbelievable news, and she knew she had to do it.
She did not have documents to work across the border, but she took the challenge and boarded a bus. Luckily, she was not interrogated, and she safely landed in LA. She felt under-confident after entering the Playboy mansion and watching the women there. She felt lucky to be there, but at the same time, she was unsure about her life's purpose. They dyed her hair blonde.
Once she started shooting, she got comfortable with the camera facing her. There was a sudden spurt of confidence once she stood in front of the camera and realized she was indeed good at it. The photo-shoot for Playboy was Pamela's way of owning and expressing her sexuality. After being violated multiple times in her life, she found her voice and confidence during the photo-shoot.After the shoot, she was asked by Grabowski to stay back in LA and work as a playmate. She was truthful about her decision to get implants on television. Though her honesty was remarkable, it was ridiculous how the interviewers (predominantly men) always circled back to her body and implants. Pamela always felt that her breasts had a career, and she was only along for a ride.
By 1991, She was popular, but she wanted to explore her opportunities and try a career in acting. "Pamela: A Love Story" further dives deep into her acting career, her infamous love story with Tommy Lee, and the private tape scandal that the couple had to face.
Via Playboy, Pamela got an audition for Baywatch. Pamela felt that the beach was too far away and canceled on them 11 times. 1992, CJ was born. Baywatch got popular and was even dubbed in Mandarin.
Pamela dated many many guys during her time on the show. She opened a nightclub in 1994 called Sanctuary.The romance between Pamela and Tommy bloomed in Cancun. Tommy was a drummer in a Rock Band. He had a bad boy image.
Pamela was there for a shoot, and Tommy followed, hoping to connect with her. She decided to give him a chance, and they partied one night. They were instantly attracted to each other and decided to get married. She was a romantic at heart and had always wanted to get married. Tommy gave her the assurance that no one had given her in the past years, and it just felt right for them.
She got married in a bikini while he was in shorts. It took them four days to know that they were meant to be. It was all so sudden that Pam remembered asking Tommy his last name after getting married to him. On their flight back home, it struck her how real their commitment was and how she barely knew the person she planned to spend the rest of her life with. Though Pamela continues to believe that people change over the years, no matter how much time you spend with someone, there is no guarantee that they are going to stay the same. She had always been unafraid of falling in love, and with Tommy, it was the same. He had a bad boy image, and Pamela complimented him.After the success of Baywatch, Pamela wanted a meaty role, and she landed with Barb Wire in 1995. After the Cannes interview, the producers believed that the film had immense potential and invested huge amounts of money in it. The script changed multiple times, and by the time Pamela started acting, she was clueless about the film. She went through a miscarriage while shooting, and that further affected her mentally.
Barb Wire failed at the box office, but she could not care less about the failure of the film, as she was completely shaken after losing her baby. Pamela took to drugs to ease her pain.
She soon got pregnant again, and since the couple had a tendency to document their lives, we get to watch Pamela's pregnancy journey.After the birth of their first child in 1996, they decided to remodel their house. During this time, they realized that their safe had gone missing. For the last six months, there were workers all around the house, and they did not know who was responsible for it. Soon they were sent a copy of a videotape stolen from their house. The tape consisted of the couple's intimate moments.They were contacted by Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse; he wanted to buy the rights to the video for 5 million dollars, but the couple rejected it. They simply wanted to get the video back, and they had no intention of making money out of it. It was soon announced that the home video would be distributed and available for public viewing. Their video was uploaded to the internet by Internet Entertainment Group, grabbing the attention of the entire world. They filed a case against the IEG since they had not signed any agreement allowing the distribution of their public property.
Ed Masry (the lawyer from Erin Brockovich) took their case.She was pregnant again when the deposition started, and the couple decided to withdraw the case over their concern for the baby's health. She compared the usage of the videotape with sexual assault. She felt equally vulnerable and violated. After the circulation of the videotape, Pamela's career took a dip, while Tommy's was barely affected by it. As a woman, she was looked down upon, and it was assumed that the couple was somehow behind the scandal for publicity. They did not know how to react to the circulation of the video, and it often resulted in violent behavior in public.
Pamela maintains that she never made a dime off the video, and it was circulated all over the world via the internet. Pamela knew at that point that her career was over.Tommy got jealous when Pamela kissed an actor on the sets of Baywatch. They had their 2nd kid and grew even more apart. One night, Tommy hit Pamela after they got into an argument. Pamela called 911. Tommy was arrested for kicking Pamela while she was holding their son.
Pamela and Tommy chose to separate after he was tried in court for physically abusing her. She filed a case against him, and he was imprisoned for six months. He was ashamed of his violent behavior. After giving birth to two children, Tommy felt a desperate need to grab Pamela's attention, though such reasons are unacceptable.Even after separating, they continued to co-parent their children. In the documentary, Pamela expresses how Tommy was the love of her life, and though there were lows, the highs made it worth the journey. Pamela's sons, Brandon and Dylan, state that they never considered any of Pamela's other four husbands as their father. She married Kid Rock in 2006 but didn't find her love. After her divorce, she met Rick Salomon, who was a professional poker player. She married Rick in 2007 and he ended up being a drug addict. She had it annulled. She again married Rick in 2014 after he had been sobered for many years. That didn't last long either.
They knew they were just visitors in their lives who would eventually leave. Tommy continues to be their sole father figure.
Pamela joined PETA and used her sexuality to bring attention to the issue of animal rights. She used her celebrity status to raise a lot of money for the organization. She had a relationship with Julian Assange.The popularity of the sex tape scandal made the boys childhoods difficult. They were taunted by their friends and often got involved in fights. Her sons believe that their mother is a romantic and that she can never truly give up on pursuing love. Brandon thinks that his mother should have sold the rights to the video for money. He explains that she lived in debt all her life, and the money could have at least helped her when the video ruined her career. Pamela continues to stand by her decision; she could not allow the public viewing of her private life on any given day. Her rejection of the offer is a testament to her strong values."Pamela: A Love Story" ends on a positive note, with Pamela finally getting the recognition she desired for her Broadway performance. She starred in the musical "Chicago" as Roxie. She took the role even though she was 50 years old. The show opened April12th, 2022. Pamela has fun on the sets and the show receives very positive reviews from the critics.
She was reminded of the trauma when Hulu released "Pamela and Tommy" without her permission, but she braved her way out of it and found a way to find peace and love herself when most were a disappointment.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2019, the Indian Government revokes Article 370, which grants special status for Jammu and Kashmir. The news impacts a cancer-ridden Pakistani army general, Qadir (Manish Wadhwa), who decides to exact vengeance against India. The doctors have given him 3 yrs to live.
He signs a contract with Jim (John Abraham), who leads "Outfit X", a private terrorist organization. Meanwhile, Pathaan (Shah Rukh Khan), a former RAW agent, and his senior officer Nandini Grewal (Dimple Kapadia) open a unit dubbed the "Joint Operations and Covert Research" (JOCR) unit, to recruit former RAW agents who were forced to retire due to past trauma or injury, but want to serve the country. Pathaan was injured in an operation in Myanmar and has metal plates in his foot and neck and screws in his shoulders to hold his body together.
JCOR includes: Shweta Bajaj (Ekta Kaul), hacker. Raza (Shaji Choudhary). Joseph Mathews (Diganta Hazarika), sniper. Amol (Aakash Bhatija). Rishi Arya (Viraf Patel), intelligence analyst.With RAW joint secretary, Colonel Sunil Luthra's (Ashutosh Rana) acceptance (Pathaan convinces him that Outfit X has its hands in all the major terrorist attacks of the last decade), Pathaan and his team head to Dubai to stop Outfit X's plans of attacking the President of India at a scientific conference. However, they realize that their actual plan was to kidnap two scientists, Dr. Farooqui (Prem Jhangiani) and Dr. Sahani (Prakash Belawadi) instead and the information they received about the imminent attack on the President was a ruse to mislead them. The Indian agencies increased the security for the President and reduced it for the scientists. Pathaan goes for the scientists.
Jim attacks the scientists' convoy and Pathaan tries to stop him. A fight ensues (in which Rishi dies), where Jim manages to escape with Dr. Sahani. At the debrief back at the agency, Luthra reveals that Jim was a former RAW agent and Kabir Dhaliwal's partner. Jim was awarded with the Vir Puraskar for his bravery after the agency could not find his body when Somalian terrorists killed his wife and unborn child (Jim had extracted 6 hostages from the terrorists. The terrorists kidnapped him and his wife and wanted 10 crores for their release, which the Govt refused to pay). He had apparently faked his death in order to seek vengeance against the agency and country for not saving his family.Meanwhile, Pathaan learns about the code-word dubbed "Raktbeej" and also that the dead people in Dubai were ex-agents and their money was transferred from the account of Rubina "Rubai" Mohsin (Deepika Padukone), a Pakistani doctor in Spain. He travels to Spain and is captured by Jim's men, where he also learns that Rubai is an ex-ISI agent who works for JIm. Jim wants to recruit Pathaan into the Outfit X, but he refuses. Jim argues that they work on choice assignments and are paid handsomely.
When Jim leaves his hideout, Rubai attacks Jim's men and escapes with Pathaan. Rubai is hit in the abdomen and Pathaan saves her. Rubai reveals that Raktbeej is in Moscow (Nandini advises against going after Raktbeej as they don't know what it is. and Russia is a friendly country and an all), where they travel to steal it before Jim does. The raktbeej is stored in the world's most secure vault with elaborate security measures. They fall in love with each other, trading stories of their past and how they came into the spy profession. Pathaan devices a plan to break into the vault and succeeds.
However, Rubai betrays Pathaan and has him captured by the Russian police who converge at the vault, as Rubai escapes with the Raktbeej. It is revealed that Jim used Rubai to make Pathaan steal the Raktbeej for himself. Pathaan is captured (& tortured brutally) (Nandini tells the Russians that Pathaan is a rogue agent and his actions were not sanctioned by the Govt of India) and taken to prison by train, but is saved by Avinash "Tiger" Singh Rathore (Salman Khan).Three years later, Pathaan travels to Africa and captures Jim's henchman Raafe (Rajat Kaul). He is tracking Rubai. Pathaan abducts Raafe from an arms market and flies off in an helicopter after a brutal fight with the arm seller. Pathaan meets Nandini and reveals about Jim purchasing two saber missiles, while Nandini reveals Rubai's location in Paris (the JCOR facial recognition software identified her roaming the streets of Paris).
Pathaan meets Rubai (he knows that Rubai being tracked JOCR was an invitation by Rubai for a meeting), who reveals that the Raktbeej is a mutated smallpox virus (the current vaccines don't work against it), which was forcibly developed by a captive Dr. Sahani under Jim's orders. She also expresses guilt about betraying Pathaan without knowing that her country would plan such an heinous attack (she reveals Gen Qadir was paying Jim). The virus is effective only for a few hrs and thus no risk of global contagion. It will only devastate Indian cities against which it will be launched via missiles.
They travel to Jim's lab in Siberia (They cannot destroy it with missiles as virus could escape and travel via could to 3 continents) and manage to recover one orb containing the virus with great difficulty, while Jim escapes with the other orb. Luthra and Nandini reach Jim's lab to take the orb back to the Indian Institute of Contagious Diseases (IICD), in India in order to develop a vaccine. Luthra also has Rubai arrested for having questionable loyalties.At the IICD in India, Dr. Farooqui demonstrates the orb to Nandini. Jim calls them and reveals that the orb has already spread the virus in the facility. The infected scientists, along with Nandini die in the facility by shooting themselves, to curb the spread of the virus. Later, the facility is destroyed in a controlled blast. Jim provides an ultimatum to evacuate Indian soldiers out of Kashmir within 24 hours else he will launch the virus against an Indian city via his missile. Pathaan interrogates Raafe about the location of the missile, and learns that the missile is situated in Afghanistan. After rescuing Rubai, they lure Jim's associates into a trap, and attack Jim's base. Qadir is killed by Rubai before activating the missile containing the virus. Pathaan chases after Jim with a jet-pack and they both crash land into a cabin.Meanwhile, Rubai deactivates the missile, but finds that Raktbeej is not in the missile, but instead in a passenger-bound airplane, which is about to land in Delhi. She informs Pathaan, who finds that Jim has the detonator. Luthra calls the air traffic control to prevent the plane from landing in Delhi. In the cabin, Pathaan and Jim fight brutally, resulting in the cabin begin sliding off a cliff. Despite getting stabbed by Jim, Pathaan steals the detonator, deactivates Raktbeej and throws Jim out of the cabin as the foundation is about to break. While Jim holds onto a plank, Pathaan takes away his Vir Puraskar, deeming him unworthy of it. He stomps and breaks the plank Jim was holding onto, resulting in him falling to his apparent death. Afterwards, Pathaan is reinstated into RAW and made as the head of JOCR, while Nandini is posthumously awarded with the Vir Puraskar for her bravery.In a mid-credits scene, Pathaan and Tiger are seen pondering about retiring and suggesting young agents who can replace them, but eventually decide to keep fighting the threats themselves.</p>

                            <p>Description: In August 1990, a record store opened on Yonge St. that quickly began serving the needs of college radio and DJs who spun new sounds far from the mainstream. Through the contagious work ethic and guidance of founder Eugene Tam, organically it became the hub for "Dance" music and the genres which emerged from under that umbrella, fueling and fostering Hip-Hop and Electronic culture. Today its impact today on Toronto and by extension Canada is without question. This is the story of Play De Record.</p>

Despite Ernest's attempts at scaring teenage son Kevin (Jahi Winston), the detached, music-obsessed teen soon finds a kindred spirit in this trapped soul from the '70s and commits to helping him. Meanwhile, Kevin's affable-yet-harsh father Frank (Anthony Mackie) looks to cash in on Ernest by turning him into a social media sensation. When Frank's video of Ernest goes viral and captures the world's attention, the family lands on the radar of Dr. Leslie Monroe (Tig Notaro), a washed-up paranormal scientist who alerts her old boss, Deputy Director Arnold Schipley of the CIA (Steve Coulter), restarting a clandestine program aimed at capturing a ghost. As crowds, reporters, and government agents descend upon the Presley home, it's up to Kevin and his sharp-witted, fellow outcast neighbor Joy (Isabella Russo) to break Ernest out, uncover the mysteries of his past, and bring him the closure he needs before it's too late.—Netflix</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1968, a staid yet respected Southern California pastor, Chuck Smith, finds that his church is slowly dying with an inability to connect with the younger, live-free generation of hippies. One day, his daughter, Janette, gives a ride to a colorful hippie hitchhiker named Lonnie Frisbee, who says he is traveling around and telling people about the Ministry of Jesus. Smith, at first suspicious of Frisbee, eventually warms up to him and welcomes other hippies to his house. This includes Lonnie introducing Chuck to a band called Love Song, who proceeds to perform a song in his living room. They join forces and start a successful movement to evangelize hippies and others. Meanwhile, high-school student Greg Laurie runs away from his Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps class and joins a girl named Cathe who "turns him on" to a Janis Joplin concert, with Timothy Leary preaching the value of drugs for self-discovery. However, Greg sees that various hippies are dangerously irresponsible; Cathe's sister gets sick from a drug overdose. When watching a movie, Cathe gets angry at Greg for not caring about how dangerous drugs are and breaks their friendship. At the hippie campus, Cathe is listening to Lonnie preach; Greg then comes over and they reconcile, ending with Cathe telling him she found a church and he should come visit. Greg and Cathe find solace at Smith and Frisbee's ministry, though Cathe's uptight parents are not enthusiastic about Greg. The ministry explodes in popularity, being seen as a "Jesus Revolution" or "Jesus freaks", and even sparking a Time magazine cover in 1971.[4] However, Lonnie eventually leaves for Florida after having disagreements with Chuck Smith. Greg offers to take over a ministry branch in Riverside, and eventually marries Cathe and becomes a famous pastor himself. Smith and Frisbee are remembered as founders of the widespread Calvary Chapel movement, and more generally as leaders in the Jesus movement.</p>

Secluded away, deep in the Bavarian Alps, Hitler, his family and closest allies hid away- issuing orders for armies across Europe while they relaxed, dined and enjoyed an otherworldly peace. There's something chilling about the horror of the nazis being shrouded in mundane moments with a family but here... captured on film, and restored to incredible quality, these are Hitler's Home Movies."</p>

                            <p>Description: Tom is the owner of a used bookstore in New York City. One day, a woman named Sandra comes in looking for a book, and after initially declining his advances, the two begin a romance. Weeks into their relationship, Sandra tells Tom that her brother is in debt and must pay $350,000 or be killed. Tom reveals that his father is wealthy, and offers to cover the debt. After providing the money to Sandra, she disappears, pushing Tom into a nervous breakdown.
Sandra's past is revealed as a parolee with a long criminal history. One night, before her relationship with Tom, she is meeting with her parole officer, who attempts to shake her down for money. She is paid off by an apparently wealthy man, Max, who is actually a con artist. He takes Sandra on as a partner, and trains her to pull cons. After taking down their first mark together, the two have sex.
Before his partnership with Sandra, Max visits his mother, Madeline, and her new boyfriend, billionaire Richard Hobbes, at Richard's lavish apartment. Max, who appears drunk and belligerent, convinces Madeline to allow him to stay at Richard's apartment. The next day, Madeline and Richard come home to Max apparently being arrested for soliciting drugs from an undercover police officer. Madeline quickly realizes that Max is pulling a con to have Richard pay off the officer, Max's partner Tipsy. Madeline forces Max to leave the apartment, but it is later revealed that Madeline and Max are lovers, not mother and son, and are targeting Richard.
Richard meets with Max, who demands a year's salary in cash in order to leave Madeline alone to be with Richard. While meeting with him, Max also meets Richard's son-Tom, who has not yet met Sandra. Max, Madeline, and Tipsy celebrate a successful job, but that evening, Madeline tells Max that Richard wants to marry her, and she will be staying with him. Max escapes from the police Madeline has called and leaves with the money.
Richard dies, leaving the vast majority of his estate to Madeline. Due to Richard's misgivings about Tom after the incident with Sandra, Tom has been left only the bookstore. He has also been named chairman of Richard's foundation, while Madeline is a trustee.
Tom hires an old family friend, Braddock, to locate Sandra. Despite Madeline's attempts to convince Tom to call off the investigation, Sandra is found, heavily addicted to heroin. Tom wants her to stay at the apartment while she goes through detox, but Madeline is reticent. She speaks to Sandra, who reveals that she knows the connection between Madeline and Max. In return for her silence, Sandra demands that Madeline track down Max so she can confront him about abandoning her.
Max agrees to meet with Sandra and Madeline. During the meeting, Tom and Braddock arrive to confirm Tom's suspicions that the three had been working together. Tom pulls a gun on Sandra, then on Madeline. Sandra forces the gun out of Tom's hands, and it is picked up by Madeline, who apparently shoots and kills Tom after he forces her to point the gun at him and pull the trigger. Desperate to avoid prison, Madeline immediately transfers all the money to Richard's foundation.
Madeline, Max, and Sandra are put on a plane to Oklahoma City. Madeline reminds Max that she will retain control of the money, since Tom is dead and she is the trustee of Richard's foundation. After a distraught Sandra retreats to the bathroom, Madeline realizes that the blood on her sleeve is not real, meaning Tom is alive. When Madeline checks the bathroom, Sandra is gone.
The true nature of the scheme is revealed; Sandra-who prefers going by "Sandy"-confesses the truth to Tom and the two devise a plan to con Madeline and Max, enlisting Tipsy and his partner Goldie-who posed as "Braddock"-to assist them. The meeting between Sandra and Max was planned, as was Tom's apparent shooting at Madeline's hands. Since Tom is still alive, he maintains control over the foundation and the money. Tom, Sandra, Tipsy, and Goldie meet at the bookstore to celebrate their success. Tom and Sandra begin to rekindle their relationship.</p>

He went viral during the pandemic and managed to get himself in trouble with pretty much everyone. Luckily, Hughesy is zen. He is at peace with the chaos he creates, knowing that from great turmoil comes even greater material. Hughesy has always attacked his comedy like a man with nothing to lose. A week hasn't gone by in the last 25 years that Hughesy hasn't done stand up, whether headlining an iconic theatre or jumping up at a tiny club. What has worried him that day becomes fodder for that night's material. To him, every audience is a great crowd and they should never forget that.</p>

                            <p>Description: Platonic friends Riley Smith and Nate Fisher have just received their MBAs from Stanford University. Going on a bender together to drown their sorrows each for a different reason, they awaken the morning after in bed together in a Las Vegas hotel room to discover that they got married. The reason for Riley's drunken spree is because the corporate job offer she had in Los Angeles fell through for reasons not of her own doing, no job meaning that she remains deep in debt from student loans. Beyond their marriage which they plan on getting annulled, Nate offers her a job with his family's struggling business in small town Cedar Falls, TN. Despite being a west coaster through and through, Riley ultimately accepts Nate's offer if only temporarily while she gets on her feet financially. What she doesn't expect is that Nate tells his family of their marriage in they being more accepting of her working in the business in she being family herself. Riley also makes several discoveries in town. First, the reason for Nate's bender was because his high school sweetheart girlfriend Emily, to who he was going to propose, broke up with him in she feeling he not being there for her, she who ended up marrying Andrew, the football quarterback. Second, what Riley assumed was going to be a small mom and pop "Fisher" business is instead the nationwide "Bynam" (Nate having used his mother's maiden name of Fisher in college in not wanting to coast on the family name) discount big box retailer, Buy Rite. Riley has always used Buy Rite's corporate philosophy to illustrate how not to operate a business. The company has been struggling ever since Nate's mother passed, she the corporate brains with Nate's father, "Buck" Bynam, a "my way or the highway" type man, espousing the bottom line in the simplistic mind set of minimizing expenditures while maximizing revenues. Buck doesn't trust Riley in believing her to be purely a gold-digger after the Bynam money, but the real reason for his dislike of her is being scared of any change that could jeopardize his position. However, Nate's grandmother, Faye Bynam, the company's matriarch, quietly sees in Riley just what the company needs. And third, the man Riley made a connection with when she first arrived into town is Nate's brother, Rhys Bynam, who has always had an issue with Buck but who has returned to town to help get the company back on its feet. Riley and Rhys mutually falling for each other has the obvious obstacle of Riley and Nate's "marriage".—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Carrying on the legacy of her deceased Belgian paternal grandfather, Lucy Sweet is the master chocolatier at How Sweet It Is in the Midwestern town of Watson Corners, the store which she owns and operates with her widowed mother, Helen Sweet. In this new year, they are facing a massive rent increase, which they can only cover by increased business in what is their busy season in the lead up to Valentine's Day or risk closing altogether. In the unwitting help of Lucy's best friend Serena and their new employee Georgie, whose social media posts are increasing the shop's exposure, Lucy and Helen believe the way out of their financial predicament is the chocolate cupid, a confection which was originally only given/sold to friends and family in the legend that eating it will lead to true love for those whose hearts are open to it. Lucy had long created a wall in the shop featuring the many couples who attest to their love happening after eating the cupid, one being Helen herself and her now deceased husband, Scott Sweet. Helping or hindering that exposure is the arrival of reporter Dean Chase of Channel 55 News, who was given the assignment of covering the legend of chocolate cupid by the station's news director, Nora Nguyen. The issue with Dean is that he is renowned for his no holds barred exposés, he only given this assignment by Nora to help him show the network brass that he's not a one trick pony in being considered for a job he really wants as a news anchor for their Chicago affiliate's morning show. Dean's initial inclination is to call out the fraud that is the cupid in he truly believing it to be such, he changing his tune if only in the goal of the promotion. All this added exposure does the trick of the needed increased revenue, with the question being whether Dean is converted as he and Lucy spend time together and start to fall for each other. This item may be tested as Nora wants this extended assignment to culminate on Valentine's Day with Dean eating a cupid on camera, a long term arrangement with Lucy which may be incompatible with his professional end goal of a job in New York City. It may also test Lucy's commitment as she admits to never have eaten a cupid herself not so much in fearing love, but what comes after love, namely pain and heartbreak as witnessed by the extreme grief experienced by Helen when Scott died.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Scientist Richard Quinn is hunting down the chupacabra, a supposedly mythical creature, in San Javier to harness its alleged powers. Locating one with it baby in an old mine, he chases it. Injured by a passing vehicle, she leaves her baby hidden to lure the pursuing scientists away. Following the death of his father Beto from cancer, 13-year-old Alex flies to Mexico to meet his extended family for the first time, a trip his father had planned for them both. Alex meets his grandfather Chava, a former lucha libre champion, energetic wrestling-obsessed cousin Memo, and fearless hip cousin Luna. Just as Alex begins to get his bearings, on his first night he discovers a young chupacabra cub. He wakes to find it licking a cut on his hand. As Alex realizes they aren't positively regarded, he says nothing. A short time later, Luna drives Memo and Alex into town to search for Chava. She explains that he often wanders off (he may have Alzheimer's disease). In the market Alex sees a miniature colorful figure, which the seller tells him is a chupacabra, which he says is not such a bad creature. Back on the road, the kids find Chava walking with a goat. He bought it but can't explain why. On their return to the ranch, they come across some men carefully searching an area where Quinn finds evidence of what he believes is of the chupacabra. At the ranch house, they watch yet another news report on the feared full-grown chupacabra, fabled to feed on livestock. Chava turns off the TV, saying it's nonsense and lies. Once he goes out, Alex tells Luna that their grandfather is hiding something. He shows her a small music box he found him playing in the barn. She chalks it up to more evidence of his suspected Alzeimer's. Alex plays the music box in the doorway of the barn later. Hearing a mix of cooing and other sounds, he turns to see a strange creature. A mix between a mammal and a bird, furry but with wings the size of a small dog, Alex gets it a plate of sausages from the house to see if it's hungry. When a thunder storm rolls through, he promises to protect it. Alex wakes to Memo looking for him. He tries to usher him out of the barn, but the young chupacabra presents himself as Alex befriended him. He has just gotten Memo calmed down when Luna shows up. Also initially screaming, they show her he's friendly. Luna thinks they should put him out, but Alex insists they need to protect it as if it's a baby. Chava comes in, agreeing with Alex. Chupa, as Alex has named it, approaches him. Chava explains that he'd accidentally hit its parent with his car some nights ago and had found it hiding nearby. He is keeping it a secret as he knows people are looking to exploit it. Returning to the house, Quinn introduces himself, explaining he's from an American government agency which seeks rare species for medical purposes. Finding a license plate from the crash site, he's traced it to him. Chava refuses to let him snoop around, offering to demonstrate a lucha libre move if he doesn't leave. After Alex promises Chupa he will find his family, Memo comes to teach it to fly. Taking it to the barn roof, Memo fearlessly 'flies' into a haystack below. Encouraging it to follow, Chupa gets the wings to work a bit before also falling into the hay. In the house, Chava shows Alex a video of El Perico Verde doing his signature move Suplex, which he had taught him himself. He reveals that Beto was the fighter, but never became professional because he met Alex's mother and moved to the States. Once Chava talks about Beto enough to sadden Alex, he pulls out his Game Boy. He recognizes it's his way of avoiding his feelings. Taking the video console, Chava tells Alex he must fight him for it. Having learned that his new friend Chupa has a secret history with his family and is being hunted by the determined Quinn to try and harness his powers, the family sets off on the adventure of a lifetime to protect Chupa from impending danger.</p>

                            <p>Description: After an incident that leads to him losing his job, an assistant basketball coach, Marcus Marakovich, is given a choice by a judge between serving time in prison or doing community service coaching a team of players with learning disabilities. Marcus initially struggles with coaching this new team, but as he gets to know the players personally, he comes to realize that they are more than just their skills on the court. He also develops a casual sexual relationship with one of his player's (Johnny) sister, Alex, but complications arise when Johnny becomes attached to Marcus and Alex becomes defensive. Marcus tries to secure a new coaching job with the help of his former assistant coach, but realizes that he has been manipulative and asks him to help with coaching his team, The Friends, instead. The team faces challenges both on and off the court, but with Marcus's guidance, they begin to improve and make it to the semi-finals. However, Marcus receives news that he has been hired by an NBA team, which causes tension with The Friends. As the team prepares for the Special Olympics finals in Winnipeg, Marcus tries to set up a play that will have Darius making the final shot, but his assistant coach warns him that it's a bad idea. Marcus reevaluates his coaching approach and sets up a different play that leads to a crucial moment in the game.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

                            <p>Description: Alex, a dog trainer, considers dogs, her trusted companions, more reliable than people, a belief largely shaped by her father having abandoned her and her younger sister Sarah when they were children. Thus she chooses not to see that veterinarian Jacob, with who she volunteers at a dog shelter, is interested in her romantically, as she is not at all in the dating scene. Although initially reluctant due to the reason for the job, Alex is hired by advertising executive Simon who wants to become an instant dog person to impress his wannabe girlfriend, successful fashion designer Chloe, who dotes on her very anxious pet dog, also named Simon, who hasn't bonded with his human namesake. Alex is convinced by Sarah to take the job not so much to help a human but to help a dog, Simon the dog who probably has underlying reasons created by diva-ish Chloe as to his anxiousness. As Alex and Simon spend more and more time together, they start to form a bond, potentially romantic, which is only strengthened when Simon plays an active role in saving the shelter when it becomes threatened. In addition to Alex needing to get out of her mistrust of people, they may not be able to overcome the hurdles to that romantic relationship, either breaking out from the professional reason that brought them together in the first place, and/or getting over their respective perception of another more suitable person as a romantic partner in the other's life, namely Jacob and Chloe.—Huggo</p>

When Tess gets her big break which means an immediate move to Chicago, Olivia is forced to move out of their shared apartment by Valentine's Day two weeks away, made even more difficult as she, this time of year usually heading home to Valentine NE which the town does big for its namesake day, was unable to secure a flight home. In running into her wealthy and successful distant Los Angeles-based cousin George Kessler at a high end event catered by the company for which she and Olivia work, Tess, upon learning that George is driving back to Los Angeles in a family owned classic car, suggests he give both of them a ride, Tess to Chicago and Olivia to Valentine, which he is more than happy to do. Upon arriving in Valentine, George is faced with a time issue in making it back to Los Angeles for a meeting on Valentine's Day when the Board of the family company, Kessler + Kessler Asset Management, will vote him in as next CEO taking over from his father, the now malfunctioning car wanted by Kessler Sr. for the celebratory event following. In their time together in Valentine, Olivia and George have to get over some points of contention, which masks the mutual attraction that exists between the two. As George works to get his car fixed and as Olivia helps her sister Vanessa with the annual Valentine's Day Parade which she has taken over from a bitter Miss Hackey who was pushed out of the role after thirty years, they may help the other find their path in life, for George specifically to find his passion as opposed to the destiny set by his father, with that help borne out of Valentine's motto of love.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: It's been ten years since that New Year's Eve party when Peter made the unilateral decision that he and Lauren would move across the country for him to accept his dream job, instead of what was their in-the-works plan for Lauren to open an art gallery. Peter has always justified that decision as looking out for their financial security, which now includes for their daughter Stephanie. Feeling like she has always played second fiddle to Peter's job, he who conversely did whatever he wanted, Lauren now has divorce papers staring her in the face. Despite she the one to initiate the divorce proceedings, Lauren feels the need for the support of the love club at this time. The three other club members rushing to Lauren's side, they deal both with Lauren's professional and personal problems. With the former, they encourage her to open that art gallery in light of her lack of work experience making it difficult to find a job. With the latter, they each have different views of the state of Lauren and Peter's marriage. Nic, as the one who has been their friends the longest, believes that they are each other's soul mate if they can only find their way back to each other. Single Tara believes Lauren needs to get back into the dating scene if only to gauge her feelings. While Tara has set up a profile for her on her dating app which she clandestinely uses for other purposes on Lauren's behalf, Lauren herself may not have an issue in that department in meeting suave artist Carlos, who is overt in his interest in her. And Syd believes Steph is the key to the situation between her parents. Once they suss out the situation, Nic, Tara and Syd have to work hard to ensure that Lauren ends up with who is indeed the person meant for her, which entails rectifying some misunderstandings that may otherwise drive them apart.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: In Los Angeles in 2003, after an evening of playing poker with another couple, Debbie Dunn (Reese Witherspoon) and Peter Coleman (Ashton Kutcher) have sex and spend the night together in her home. Peter calls Debbie later and says that he is not looking to date anyone as he is unpredictable.
Peter is a budding writer. Debbie wanted to be an editor, but ended up making practical choices after she has a kid.Twenty years later, Debbie and Peter are best friends. He has moved to New York City and become a successful businessman, while she still lives in Los Angeles and works as an accountant at her son Jack's (Wesley Kimmel) middle school. Debbie calls Peter on his birthday, and they discuss her plans to head to New York soon to complete an accounting program to help her get a better-paying job (she needs this job to pay for Jack medication which costs $1000 per month and is only covered by insurance for another 6 months). During her stay in New York, Debbie will be staying at Peter's apartment.Debbie's ex-husband's (Jimmy) actress girlfriend, Scarlet (Rachel Bloom), is to watch Jack for the week but flakes when she is offered a role in Vancouver for two weeks. Peter, who has just broken up with his girlfriend and is between jobs, offers to go to LA to take care of Jack. Jack is a teenager. Peter knows that Debbie is having a panic attack about leaving Jack back home for a week. He calls Debbie's style Saran Wrap parenting. Zen (Steve Zahn) is Debbie's gardener.
Debbie is shown to be an overbearing parent to the extent that she tells Jack whom to hang out with at school.
Peter has been with his current girlfriend Becca (Vella Lovell) for 6 months. She has never met Debbie, but is a bit concerned about how much time Peter spends with her on the phone. She wants to know if she is wasting her time. Peter hesitates and Becca walks out. Peter is a marketing consultant, whose contract has just ended, so he is in between jobs.In California, Peter learns the extent of Debbie's overprotective parenting and decides to help Jack loosen up a little. Peter learns that Jack plays hockey. He cant play basketball, as he is allergic to the gym, no baseball as he is allergic to grass. Debbie has told Jack that playing hockey is too dangerous. Jack is not allowed to watch TV while eating and never before homework. Debbie doesn't allow takeout's at home either.
Peter learns that Zen is a wealthy man due to a tech buyout and just does Debbie's garden as a hobby.
Peter gets sky-box tickets to a Los Angeles Kings game and encourages Jack to invite along two classmates (to help him make friends at school), but this goes awry when they ignore him.Meanwhile in New York, Debbie attends her accounting classes and meets Peter's ex-girlfriend, Minka (Zoë Chao) (who had come to meet Peter for a booty call, but met Debbie instead), who invites her out for drinks. At the bar, Minka helps her catch the attention of book publisher Theo Martin (Jesse Williams) from Duncan Press. Debbie tells Theo that she has read every Duncan Press book ever published. Minka also informs Debbie that Peter has written a novel. This comes as a shock to Debbie as Peter never told her that he wrote a novel. Debbie reads the novel in less than a day and loves it.
After reading the manuscript, Debbie pretends to be an editor as she tries to convince Theo to give it a chance. Theo and Debbie are both divorced and have 13 yr old boys each.
Theo loves the book and wants to speak with the author.Peter grows closer to Jack and convinces the hockey coach to let him try out for the team. Peter befriends Zen and finds out that he is also Debbie's part time lover.
Meanwhile, Debbie goes out on a date with Theo, which ends with them having hooked up and spent the night together. Debbie accidentally sets off the apartment's remote camera, leading to Peter witnessing them. Disturbed, he goes to a bar and meets an old girlfriend but cannot bring himself to sleep with her. He realizes that he is in love with Debbie.On Debbie's last day in New York, she passes her exam and unintentionally discovers Peter's hidden mementos of her. When Debbie meets with Theo, he informs her that he has gotten her an interview with a major publisher. When he expresses a desire to continue dating her, she confesses that she is in love with someone else.In Los Angeles, Jack's hockey tryout goes badly, and he ends up injured. Peter calls Debbie, and she is enraged that he endangered her son even though Jack appears to be okay. Jack is happy to be on the hockey team and tells Debbie not to yell at Peter at any cost. Jack loved his week with Peter. She rushes to leave and get back home to Jack and tells Peter to be gone by the time she arrives.
Peter and Debbie come face-to-face at LAX. After a heated argument, Peter admits that he is in love with Debbie, and they kiss. Six months later, Peter has become a published author and moved in with Debbie. She is an editor at an indie publishing house, and Jack is playing on the hockey team.</p>

                            <p>Description: Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history. She ascended to the throne and was crowned Queen at the tender age of 27. During her 70-year reign, Her Majesty worked with over a dozen Prime Ministers, each of whom formed successive governments on her behalf. As a high school dropout, the teenage John Major could simply never have dreamt that he would one day become a powerful political leader and get elected as Britain's Prime Minister. Major became Her Majesty's ninth Prime Minister, having fought for the leadership of the Conservative party after Margaret Thatcher's formidable 11-year premiership. But what would the Queen make of her new Prime Minister? Sir John Major, Her Majesty's 9th Prime Minister.</p>

                            <p>Description: Needing to reconnect as wife and husband, Tracy and Nick decide to set aside work to go on their long delayed honeymoon, although they realize that the honeymoon is only a stopgap measure for the bigger problem of not being able to spend time together in their day-to-day lives. With the honeymoon, they, unlike their regular selves, decide to let fate choose where to go as their jumping off point for the first night after which they will proverbially "wing it", the only stipulation being no place that would be associated with work or be tempted to work as the biggest problem in not being to spend time together at home. That jumping off point ends up being the city of Rhodes in Greece, they planning on making a stop in Spain on their way home on Nick's family's want for them to drop the veil off with his unattached sister Monica to give her a little nudge in the matrimony department. But even that plan of Rhodes as the jumping off point doesn't come to pass in ending up further down the coast in Lindos out of circumstance, staying at a newly renovated old inn run by brother and sister Xander and Tessa, it struggling in Tracy and Nick in addition to their only other two concurrent British guests, Lady Dalton and her young adult grandson Colin Dalton, the most they've ever had at one time. Before it makes its way to Spain, someone seems to want to borrow the veil to work its magic locally. Work does seem to call on this trip for both Tracy and Nick, the latter who comes to a local in need. But Tracy thinks someone else locally is in need, namely Leo, a young proverbial street urchin whose story she and Nick will eventually learn, it being a one of his own passion battling against adult authority in looking out for his future.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1962, Boston Record American reporter Loretta McLaughlin investigates three cases of older women who were raped and murdered by strangulation in the Boston area. She confirms the victims all had stockings tied around their necks in a bow, probably connecting the crimes to a serial killer. The story angers Boston law enforcement as well as Loretta's boss, who plans to kill the report to protect the company.When a fourth victim is found, Loretta and fellow reporter Jean Cole decide to continue the investigation. The two women endure rampant sexism in their workplace and society. Loretta's marriage is strained by her long hours and her family is harassed. While writing the articles, Loretta coins the name "the Boston Strangler".One year later, a seventh woman named Sophie Clark is murdered. A neighbor encountered a man who could be the killer and she provides a vague description. Sophie is much younger than previous victims, which breaks the Strangler's pattern. Loretta and Jean later discover that the Boston Police Department is botching the investigation and not sharing information with other cities. Similar murders, like one committed in New York City by a man named Paul Dempsey, have been overlooked.Albert DeSalvo, a suspect in the investigation, is taken into custody. Sophie's neighbor is asked to identify him in a line-up but she picks a different man, George Nassar. Despite this, in 1964, DeSalvo confesses to all 13 murders. Police do not have enough evidence to tie him to the murders, so he is instead convicted for earlier crimes of robbery and sexual offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment.By 1965, Loretta learns from a police detective in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that there have been six murders there that are identical to the Boston Strangler's work. She travels to Ann Arbor and learns the most likely suspect is Daniel Marsh, an ex-boyfriend of a Strangler victim. Marsh is later arrested but refuses to cooperate with police. In 1973, DeSalvo calls Loretta and tells her to come to visiting hours the next day to hear his side of the story. Before Loretta can meet with him, he is stabbed to death by another prisoner.Following an anonymous tip, Loretta meets with Harrison, a former patient at Bridgewater State Hospital. He reveals that DeSalvo, Marsh and Nassar were all held in the same ward at the same time. Harrison also claims DeSalvo's confession was coached by Marsh and Nassar. Loretta visits Nassar in prison. He denies that he and Marsh coached DeSalvo but admits he hoped to claim the reward. He accuses Loretta and the media of creating a sensation around the Strangler and insinuates that there is more than one murderer but that the public does not want to come to terms with it.Loretta and Jean create a theory that Paul Dempsey killed the first six older women in Boston before he moved to New York. Once Dempsey left Boston, copycat murders arose, resulting in the later victims being much younger. DeSalvo confessed to all 13 murders so Nassar could collect a $10,000 reward per victim. In return, Nassar arranged for DeSalvo to be represented by high-profile lawyer F. Lee Bailey. DeSalvo was also deceived into believing he would get a million-dollar book deal that could support his family. The Record American publishes Loretta and Jean's theory.An epilogue tells of Loretta becoming an award-winning medical reporter at The Boston Globe. Jean continued working as a reporter for 30 years. She and Loretta remained close friends. Marsh was never charged with murder. Nassar never received a reward and is incorrectly said to still be in prison as of 2023.[a] In 2013, DNA evidence linked DeSalvo to the 13th murder but not the other 12</p>

                            <p>Description: In March of 2017, Baltimore was rocked by one of the nation's largest Police corruption scandals when seven members of the elite Gun Trace Task Force unit were federally indicted on racketeering charges. Defense attorney Ivan Bates wasn't shocked by the news because for years he had been listening to the victims of these crimes and had been trying to bring down the corrupt sergeant. I GOT A MONSTER is the true story of a cat-and-mouse game in an upside-down world where the cops are also the robbers.—themoviedb</p>

                            <p>Description: Novelist James Foster and his wife Em spend time at a resort in the fictional seaside country of Li Tolqa,[3] where a local festival is underway. The couple's chronic marital strife is exacerbated when Gabi, a fan of the only novel James has published to date, invites them to spend time with her and her husband Alban. The four have dinner and decide to spend the next day driving in the countryside, even though they have been warned that tourists are to remain on the resort compound at all times.At a beach, as James urinates behind a tree, Gabi unexpectedly grabs him from behind and proceeds to give him a handjob. After a long day of sunbathing and cooking, the tourists embark on a drunken drive back to their hotel. En route, James accidentally runs over a local man, killing him. Gabi insists that they cannot call the police, as the country is corrupt and they will not be safe.The next day, James is arrested and is told that the penalty for his crime is death at the hand of the dead man's firstborn son. However, the country has a unique system of justice whereby the guilty, for a hefty fee, can be cloned and have their duplicates killed in their place. James, who married into money, pays the fee to have a double killed before his eyes. Em is horrified by the entire affair and wants to leave immediately, but James is titillated by the spectacle and wants to stay. He hides his passport, claiming that he has lost it, and encourages Em to return to the United States.James extends his stay by a week and encounters Gabi and Alban again. They introduce him to a small group of Western tourists who all have been convicted of serious crimes and have paid to watch their doubles killed. These people return to the resort annually, commit heinous crimes, and pay to watch their doubles get slaughtered. Over the next several days, they encourage James to transform into a libertine criminal, encouraging him to kill locals, engage in intoxicated orgies, and abuse the resort staff.James is rattled one night when he is tricked into brutalizing a clone of himself he had been led to believe was the police detective who initially arrested him. In a moment of clarity and panic, James retrieves his hidden passport and attempts to flee, but the tourist group accosts him and abducts him from the bus transporting him to the airport. Gabi reveals that she finds him pathetic and that the group is abusing him for their own amusement, hoping to turn him into a fellow murder tourist. He runs off into a nearby wilderness. Gabi shoots him in the leg as he flees.After hours of wandering, James collapses at a farm, where a local family takes him in to recuperate. In his drugged state, he experiences a series of hallucinations. Once he has regained his strength, he is again confronted by Gabi's group, who orders him to kill a duplicate of himself to complete his transformation. He initially refuses, but when the clone attempts to kill him, James beats him to death. As a reward, Gabi exposes her bare breast to James, inviting him to breastfeed.The next day, as they head back to the United States, the other tourists casually chat about upcoming errands, while James is visibly shaken from the events of the past few days. Waiting in the airport for his flight, he resolves to remain behind instead. He returns to the closed resort, where he sits alone amidst the downpour of the monsoon.</p>

                            <p>Description: Tom is the owner of a used bookstore in New York City. One day, a woman named Sandra comes in looking for a book, and after initially declining his advances, the two begin a romance. Weeks into their relationship, Sandra tells Tom that her brother is in debt and must pay $350,000 or be killed. Tom reveals that his father is wealthy, and offers to cover the debt. After providing the money to Sandra, she disappears, pushing Tom into a nervous breakdown.
Sandra's past is revealed as a parolee with a long criminal history. One night, before her relationship with Tom, she is meeting with her parole officer, who attempts to shake her down for money. She is paid off by an apparently wealthy man, Max, who is actually a con artist. He takes Sandra on as a partner, and trains her to pull cons. After taking down their first mark together, the two have sex.
Before his partnership with Sandra, Max visits his mother, Madeline, and her new boyfriend, billionaire Richard Hobbes, at Richard's lavish apartment. Max, who appears drunk and belligerent, convinces Madeline to allow him to stay at Richard's apartment. The next day, Madeline and Richard come home to Max apparently being arrested for soliciting drugs from an undercover police officer. Madeline quickly realizes that Max is pulling a con to have Richard pay off the officer, Max's partner Tipsy. Madeline forces Max to leave the apartment, but it is later revealed that Madeline and Max are lovers, not mother and son, and are targeting Richard.
Richard meets with Max, who demands a year's salary in cash in order to leave Madeline alone to be with Richard. While meeting with him, Max also meets Richard's son-Tom, who has not yet met Sandra. Max, Madeline, and Tipsy celebrate a successful job, but that evening, Madeline tells Max that Richard wants to marry her, and she will be staying with him. Max escapes from the police Madeline has called and leaves with the money.
Richard dies, leaving the vast majority of his estate to Madeline. Due to Richard's misgivings about Tom after the incident with Sandra, Tom has been left only the bookstore. He has also been named chairman of Richard's foundation, while Madeline is a trustee.
Tom hires an old family friend, Braddock, to locate Sandra. Despite Madeline's attempts to convince Tom to call off the investigation, Sandra is found, heavily addicted to heroin. Tom wants her to stay at the apartment while she goes through detox, but Madeline is reticent. She speaks to Sandra, who reveals that she knows the connection between Madeline and Max. In return for her silence, Sandra demands that Madeline track down Max so she can confront him about abandoning her.
Max agrees to meet with Sandra and Madeline. During the meeting, Tom and Braddock arrive to confirm Tom's suspicions that the three had been working together. Tom pulls a gun on Sandra, then on Madeline. Sandra forces the gun out of Tom's hands, and it is picked up by Madeline, who apparently shoots and kills Tom after he forces her to point the gun at him and pull the trigger. Desperate to avoid prison, Madeline immediately transfers all the money to Richard's foundation.
Madeline, Max, and Sandra are put on a plane to Oklahoma City. Madeline reminds Max that she will retain control of the money, since Tom is dead and she is the trustee of Richard's foundation. After a distraught Sandra retreats to the bathroom, Madeline realizes that the blood on her sleeve is not real, meaning Tom is alive. When Madeline checks the bathroom, Sandra is gone.
The true nature of the scheme is revealed; Sandra-who prefers going by "Sandy"-confesses the truth to Tom and the two devise a plan to con Madeline and Max, enlisting Tipsy and his partner Goldie-who posed as "Braddock"-to assist them. The meeting between Sandra and Max was planned, as was Tom's apparent shooting at Madeline's hands. Since Tom is still alive, he maintains control over the foundation and the money. Tom, Sandra, Tipsy, and Goldie meet at the bookstore to celebrate their success. Tom and Sandra begin to rekindle their relationship.</p>

Secluded away, deep in the Bavarian Alps, Hitler, his family and closest allies hid away- issuing orders for armies across Europe while they relaxed, dined and enjoyed an otherworldly peace. There's something chilling about the horror of the nazis being shrouded in mundane moments with a family but here... captured on film, and restored to incredible quality, these are Hitler's Home Movies."</p>

                            <p>Description: In August 1990, a record store opened on Yonge St. that quickly began serving the needs of college radio and DJs who spun new sounds far from the mainstream. Through the contagious work ethic and guidance of founder Eugene Tam, organically it became the hub for "Dance" music and the genres which emerged from under that umbrella, fueling and fostering Hip-Hop and Electronic culture. Today its impact today on Toronto and by extension Canada is without question. This is the story of Play De Record.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2019, the Indian Government revokes Article 370, which grants special status for Jammu and Kashmir. The news impacts a cancer-ridden Pakistani army general, Qadir (Manish Wadhwa), who decides to exact vengeance against India. The doctors have given him 3 yrs to live.
He signs a contract with Jim (John Abraham), who leads "Outfit X", a private terrorist organization. Meanwhile, Pathaan (Shah Rukh Khan), a former RAW agent, and his senior officer Nandini Grewal (Dimple Kapadia) open a unit dubbed the "Joint Operations and Covert Research" (JOCR) unit, to recruit former RAW agents who were forced to retire due to past trauma or injury, but want to serve the country. Pathaan was injured in an operation in Myanmar and has metal plates in his foot and neck and screws in his shoulders to hold his body together.
JCOR includes: Shweta Bajaj (Ekta Kaul), hacker. Raza (Shaji Choudhary). Joseph Mathews (Diganta Hazarika), sniper. Amol (Aakash Bhatija). Rishi Arya (Viraf Patel), intelligence analyst.With RAW joint secretary, Colonel Sunil Luthra's (Ashutosh Rana) acceptance (Pathaan convinces him that Outfit X has its hands in all the major terrorist attacks of the last decade), Pathaan and his team head to Dubai to stop Outfit X's plans of attacking the President of India at a scientific conference. However, they realize that their actual plan was to kidnap two scientists, Dr. Farooqui (Prem Jhangiani) and Dr. Sahani (Prakash Belawadi) instead and the information they received about the imminent attack on the President was a ruse to mislead them. The Indian agencies increased the security for the President and reduced it for the scientists. Pathaan goes for the scientists.
Jim attacks the scientists' convoy and Pathaan tries to stop him. A fight ensues (in which Rishi dies), where Jim manages to escape with Dr. Sahani. At the debrief back at the agency, Luthra reveals that Jim was a former RAW agent and Kabir Dhaliwal's partner. Jim was awarded with the Vir Puraskar for his bravery after the agency could not find his body when Somalian terrorists killed his wife and unborn child (Jim had extracted 6 hostages from the terrorists. The terrorists kidnapped him and his wife and wanted 10 crores for their release, which the Govt refused to pay). He had apparently faked his death in order to seek vengeance against the agency and country for not saving his family.Meanwhile, Pathaan learns about the code-word dubbed "Raktbeej" and also that the dead people in Dubai were ex-agents and their money was transferred from the account of Rubina "Rubai" Mohsin (Deepika Padukone), a Pakistani doctor in Spain. He travels to Spain and is captured by Jim's men, where he also learns that Rubai is an ex-ISI agent who works for JIm. Jim wants to recruit Pathaan into the Outfit X, but he refuses. Jim argues that they work on choice assignments and are paid handsomely.
When Jim leaves his hideout, Rubai attacks Jim's men and escapes with Pathaan. Rubai is hit in the abdomen and Pathaan saves her. Rubai reveals that Raktbeej is in Moscow (Nandini advises against going after Raktbeej as they don't know what it is. and Russia is a friendly country and an all), where they travel to steal it before Jim does. The raktbeej is stored in the world's most secure vault with elaborate security measures. They fall in love with each other, trading stories of their past and how they came into the spy profession. Pathaan devices a plan to break into the vault and succeeds.
However, Rubai betrays Pathaan and has him captured by the Russian police who converge at the vault, as Rubai escapes with the Raktbeej. It is revealed that Jim used Rubai to make Pathaan steal the Raktbeej for himself. Pathaan is captured (& tortured brutally) (Nandini tells the Russians that Pathaan is a rogue agent and his actions were not sanctioned by the Govt of India) and taken to prison by train, but is saved by Avinash "Tiger" Singh Rathore (Salman Khan).Three years later, Pathaan travels to Africa and captures Jim's henchman Raafe (Rajat Kaul). He is tracking Rubai. Pathaan abducts Raafe from an arms market and flies off in an helicopter after a brutal fight with the arm seller. Pathaan meets Nandini and reveals about Jim purchasing two saber missiles, while Nandini reveals Rubai's location in Paris (the JCOR facial recognition software identified her roaming the streets of Paris).
Pathaan meets Rubai (he knows that Rubai being tracked JOCR was an invitation by Rubai for a meeting), who reveals that the Raktbeej is a mutated smallpox virus (the current vaccines don't work against it), which was forcibly developed by a captive Dr. Sahani under Jim's orders. She also expresses guilt about betraying Pathaan without knowing that her country would plan such an heinous attack (she reveals Gen Qadir was paying Jim). The virus is effective only for a few hrs and thus no risk of global contagion. It will only devastate Indian cities against which it will be launched via missiles.
They travel to Jim's lab in Siberia (They cannot destroy it with missiles as virus could escape and travel via could to 3 continents) and manage to recover one orb containing the virus with great difficulty, while Jim escapes with the other orb. Luthra and Nandini reach Jim's lab to take the orb back to the Indian Institute of Contagious Diseases (IICD), in India in order to develop a vaccine. Luthra also has Rubai arrested for having questionable loyalties.At the IICD in India, Dr. Farooqui demonstrates the orb to Nandini. Jim calls them and reveals that the orb has already spread the virus in the facility. The infected scientists, along with Nandini die in the facility by shooting themselves, to curb the spread of the virus. Later, the facility is destroyed in a controlled blast. Jim provides an ultimatum to evacuate Indian soldiers out of Kashmir within 24 hours else he will launch the virus against an Indian city via his missile. Pathaan interrogates Raafe about the location of the missile, and learns that the missile is situated in Afghanistan. After rescuing Rubai, they lure Jim's associates into a trap, and attack Jim's base. Qadir is killed by Rubai before activating the missile containing the virus. Pathaan chases after Jim with a jet-pack and they both crash land into a cabin.Meanwhile, Rubai deactivates the missile, but finds that Raktbeej is not in the missile, but instead in a passenger-bound airplane, which is about to land in Delhi. She informs Pathaan, who finds that Jim has the detonator. Luthra calls the air traffic control to prevent the plane from landing in Delhi. In the cabin, Pathaan and Jim fight brutally, resulting in the cabin begin sliding off a cliff. Despite getting stabbed by Jim, Pathaan steals the detonator, deactivates Raktbeej and throws Jim out of the cabin as the foundation is about to break. While Jim holds onto a plank, Pathaan takes away his Vir Puraskar, deeming him unworthy of it. He stomps and breaks the plank Jim was holding onto, resulting in him falling to his apparent death. Afterwards, Pathaan is reinstated into RAW and made as the head of JOCR, while Nandini is posthumously awarded with the Vir Puraskar for her bravery.In a mid-credits scene, Pathaan and Tiger are seen pondering about retiring and suggesting young agents who can replace them, but eventually decide to keep fighting the threats themselves.</p>

                            <p>Description: Azad (Shah Rukh Khan) is the jailer of a women's prison in Mumbai who hijacks a Mumbai Metro train along with a group of six inmates: Lakshmi (Priyamani) (The mother figure), Eeram (Sanya Malhotra) (the medic), Ishkra (Girija Oak) (The artist), Kalki (Lehar Khan) (the munitions expert), Helena (Sanjeeta Bhattacharya) (the hacker) and Janhvi (Aaliyah Qureishi) (The composer).
Azad negotiates with NSG officer Narmada Rai (Nayanthara) to ask the agriculture minister Murari Das (Naresh Gossain) to send Rs 40000 Crores in exchange for the passengers' lives. Azad has 376 hostages under his control. Azad says that on the minister's watch 10,281 farmers have committed suicide till date. Interest in farm loans is 13% and on luxury cars is only 8%.
Kalee Gaikwad (Vijay Sethupathi), a global arms dealer, learns that his daughter Alia (Ashlesha Thakur) is also one of the captives and agrees to fund the deal.When Alia questions their motive, Azad reveals his plan of donating the money towards the loan waiver of 700,000 impoverished farmers in the country. Azad says that the government waived off Rs 40,000 Crore loan taken by Kalee. While Kalki's father (Omkar Das Manikpuri) was disrobed in front of his daughter for not repaying a Rs 40,000 tractor loan, as his crops were ruined due to erratic rain patterns. He commits suicide to get Rs Lakhs compensation that the government gives for farmer's death. Kalki murdered the bank collection agent and was jailed for it.
Azad and his gang directly transfer the funds into the farmers' bank accounts and escape from the metro. Through Alia, Azad reveals his name as Vikram Rathore to Kalee. Kalee recognizes this name from his past.Meanwhile, Azad meets Narmada and her daughter Suji (Seeza Saroj Mehta) for a marriage proposal. Suji likes Azad and accepts her as her father. Eventually Narmada marries Azad as she can see that Suji really trusts Azad.Azad and his gang next kidnap the health minister (Ashwin Kaushal) and demand to introduce better infrastructure at every government hospital, in exchange for the Health Minister's life. 3 years ago, Eeram was a doctor at a government hospital where 60 children were admitted for respiratory disorder. The dean of the hospital refused to sanction Oxygen cylinders till his cut was paid. Eeram did everything she could, but could not get Oxygen for the kids, and they died. The court sentenced Eeram to life imprisonment as the dean proved that Eeram was high on drugs that day, and the cause of the children's death. Azad forces the dean to reveal the truth on national TV.
The infrastructure is immediately upgraded in the list of 236 hospitals given by Azad. Azad and his gang escape again after a shootout between Narmada and her team. Narmada found Azad's location when he asked for a chopper for his evacuation.Soon after their wedding, Narmada finds out about Azad's true identity and confronts him, but Kalee's brother Manish (Eijaz Khan) and his henchmen capture and torture them. However, Azad is saved by his doppelganger, Vikram Rathore (Shah Rukh Khan). Vikram kills all of Manish's goons and shoots Manish in the face.
Narmada finds out the identities of Azad's accomplices and confronts them by disguising herself as an inmate, where she learns about Azad and Vikram's connection. The flashback is narrated by Lakshmi.In 1986, Captain Vikram Rathore was a commando in the Special Ops unit of the Indian Army, who set out on an operation to hunt down the terrorist group responsible for attacking and killing 40 Indian civilians and 6 Indian soldiers. After facing several casualties (27 soldiers from Vikram's unit lost their lives) that were caused by malfunctioning weaponry, Vikram and his team successfully took down the terrorists. Later, Vikram filed a complaint against Kalee, who was the supplier of the weapons.Vikram proves in a military court that the guns provided are faulty, while Kalee argues that the soldiers did not study the manual properly and hence it is a human error and not a machine error.
That night Vikram and his wife, Aishwarya (Deepika Padukone), were attacked by Kalee and his henchman, Murad (Sukhi Garewal). Kalee took Vikram on-board a plane and seemingly shot him to death.
Kalee plants evidence at Vikram's house that he was selling state secrets to the enemy and sends 3 cops to harass Aishwarya and get her to sign a statement against Vikram. Aishwarya was sentenced to death for killing three cops, who were on Kalee's payroll.Afterwards, Vikram was declared a national traitor. Aishwarya was due to be hanged, but is found to be pregnant at the noose, and the death sentence is postponed till her child turns 5 years old.
Aishwarya gave birth to their child, Azad, in prison. When Azad turned five, Aishwarya asked him to prove his father's innocence and provide justice to the oppressed, before she was hanged. Azad is adopted by jail warden Kaveri (Riddhi Dogra), who was sympathetic to Aishwarya.Unknown to the world, Vikram survived the attack but lost his memory.
Vikram was found and rescued by a tribal group in northeast India and rehabilitated in their village. It has been 30 years since then.A hostage in the metro was an inhabitant of the northeast village and recognized Vikram's face in Azad. He tracked down Vikram's colleagues from the Army and brings them to the village.
Vikram accepts Azad as his son, but says that due to lack of memory, he has no feelings for Azad.Back in the present, Narmada's subordinate Irani (Sunil Grover) is revealed to be on Kalee's payroll, when he tries to kill them in the prison. Lakshmi is killed in the resulting crossfire. Azad arrives at the prison and kills Irani in a stampede by opening the prisoner barracks.
Vikram, Azad and his team attack Kalee's trucks, which contains money for the upcoming elections that will be used to boost Kalee's political ambitions. This money has been provided by the mafia, so that they can expand their illegal businesses in India after Kalee forms the next government.
Azad and his team manage to steal the trucks, while Vikram and his old army team get captured by Kalee's henchmen.While Azad was stealing the cash, Nirmala and her forces were busy stealing the electronic machines to be used in the upcoming elections.
Azad releases another video and states that he has stolen voting machines and demands to seal 53 factories in the country, responsible for air and water pollution. The factories are sealed by the government.
Kalee learns about Azad's location in the women's prison. Kalee infiltrates the prison with insider information from Vikram and captures Azad. Kalee wants to know the location of his cash and a fight ensues, where Vikram finally recovers his memory (when Kalee fires on Vikram, but his gun wont work) and helps Azad by hanging Kalee to death.A few months later, STF officer Madhavan Naik (Sanjay Dutt), who helped Azad in the completion of his missions, assigns Azad a new mission targeting Swiss banks.</p>

                            <p>Description: Set in the Caribbean, Deep Fear is an intense and visceral survival thriller with furious action throughout. Madalina Ghenea stars as Naomi, an accomplished round-the-world yachtswoman, who sets out on a solo trip to meet her boyfriend, Jackson - played by Ed Westwick - in Grenada. Her tranquil three-day sail aboard 47-foot yacht 'The Serenity' takes an unexpectedly dark turn when a storm forces her off the plotted course. Circumnavigating an uninhabited reef-fringed island, she responds to a distress signal to aid a sinking vessel where she finds three survivors clinging to the shattered remains of a boat. Events soon take a malevolent twist when it transpires the survivors are drug traffickers who force Naomi to dive down into the hull of the sunken wreck to retrieve 850 kilos of cocaine. The plan is thwarted when Naomi finds herself surrounded by a frenzy of man-eating white sharks - lured by the dead bodies in the wreck.

                            <p>Description: Single thirty-somethings Jordin, Ava, and Stella are best friends and an art, math and English teacher respectively at Garden City Collegiate. It's just before the Christmas break, and Jordin believes they have lost their mojo each for a different reason, they not having done anything exciting as friends in years. Jordin is still recovering from a break-up in the summer to her long term boyfriend Nico, and while upon reflection she isn't sure if she ever loved him, she is hurt that he has moved on in already having another girlfriend, Portia. For five years, shy Ava has pined over their fellow teacher colleague Ben without being able to tell him that she has feelings for him. And Stella still laments being transferred from the Music Department to English in she not being passionate about assigning books to her students she doesn't much like herself. To get out of their funk and spend time as friends, Jordin is able to convince them, albeit reluctantly, to do something out of their comfort zone, namely attend the Santa Summit, a big party where attendees, upwards of one thousand, dress up as Santa and party it up at different events and venues across the city. Ava is somewhat of an easy convince as she knows Ben always attends the Summit, and she hopes to run into him outside of work. Convincing Stella was already difficult enough in she having lost the spirit of Christmas, with the Summit made all the more challenging in they constantly running into a leather jacket clad Santa named Freddie, who further takes her out of her comfort zone. And Jordin has a chance meeting with a fellow Santa, Liam, they, in their connection in their few minute conversation with each other behind their Santa costumes including full beard and mustache, only knowing sparse pieces of information about the other. In accidentally losing contact with each other, each goes on a mission to locate the other in a sea of several hundred Santas not knowing the other's name or what he/she looks like behind the costume in each, without knowing how the other truly feels, believing they made a real human connection.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: The final installment of the Tales From the Occult horror anthology series arrives with Ultimate Malevolence. Tales From the Occult: Ultimate Malevolence presents three ghastly Hong Kong tales directed by Lee Chi Ngai, Peter Lee and Barry Wong that reveal the scariest and ugliest sides of human nature. In "Memento Mori," high school friends Tam (Chan Charm Man) and Yu (Will Or) are passionate about movies, but their filmmaking dreams have come up empty all these years. After accidentally killing Yu, Tam unexpectedly becomes a director. In "Killing Me Softly," magician Flora (Hunny Ho) undergoes hypnosis in hopes of finding her friend (Angel Lam) who has gone missing. Their last phone conversation may contain clues to solving the case, but the process of retrieving Flora's memories puts her in danger's way. In "No Way Out." Ho (Philip Keung) wakes up in the middle of the night inside a mysterious factory building. Afterwards, he encounters corpses, ghosts and his ex-wife (Amy Lo). He must find a way to escape the building.</p>

                            <p>Description: It's the story of the redemption of a man who was headed to hell but turned his life around. His wife, Ms. Kay stood by his side even when he didn't want her to. Through the Grace of a loving Savior, Jesus Christ, he turned his life around and created a dynasty while still holding true to his faith. Inspirational and moving. He played quarterback at Louisiana Tech University along with Terry Bradshaw and left to hunt ducks. His duck calls were hand made by him and his sons and sold basically door to door at various places of business by Phil himself.His original introduction to Jesus was done in a bar by a preacher who was sent there by his sister. She had stated that if they could convert him, he would bring thousands into the family of God, prophesying the ministry he would begin when he came home to God.It is a story to show how even the worst person, including people who have been sent to prison for unspeakable things can be turned into a son of God. Phil is a truly good man who just wants to share Jesus with everyone he comes in contact with.By sharing the embarrassment of his early years, he has shown his love for fellow man and mostly for his Father in Heaven. He has raised his family to love God. He and Ms. Kay welcome one and all into the fellowship at their church where he "preaches" from a table so he's not towering over the people as if in judgment. They welcome all colors, social levels including the homeless. Ms. Kay gives grocery gift cards away like candy. They continue to this day to give more than they receive.</p>

                            <p>Description: A man wakes in an empty suburban house with no memory and blood smeared on his arm. As he frantically washes off the blood, he discovers that it is not his. He finds sticky notes around the house that read: "Don't stay in this room." "Don't go outside." "Don't go downstairs." Confused, he tries to follow the cryptic messages, ultimately discovering two things. Memories of a mother and daughter that he is somehow connected with, and also a demonic presence living in this suburban house. As he gets closer to solving the mystery of why he is there, the demon grows stronger, testing his will to survive.</p>

                            <p>Description: Rising star DJ Chris Villa seeks redemption as he competes in the Red Bull 3Style World Championship (the "Olympics of DJ-ing") as one of 6 US Finalists. Most associate the DJ with the dark tantalizing world of nightclub culture. Drinking, drugs and sex are first among the vices we assume as part of the lifestyle. Enter DJ Chris Villa - the humble, soft-spoken husband and father of two who obliterates the stereotype while being driven by passion for the craft. Together with his staunchly supportive wife Terra, Chris sets an inspiring example for a successful relationship fraught with so many potential pitfalls. An incredible story unfolds as we follow Chris' rise from obscurity, growth of his immense talent, and perseverance through the challenges of marriage and fatherhood to create a winning set that could catapult him to superstardom. Preconceived notions will be shattered and barriers broken as the unifying power of music overcomes all. Chris shows why he's "One for All" as he lets the music do its magic and sets the stage for an explosive finale.—Vangelis Films</p>

What he doesn't know is that a drunken criminal was running from the law and committed suicide inside it. His spirit haunts the car living in anger. Once Mr. Anderson discovers the car is possessed by going through many weird and crazy events, he tries to sell the car instead of just giving it away or back to the mechanic. For that, he pays the price of his little Jesus freak soul.</p>

                            <p>Description: The demise of European colonialism has never been captured in a more vibrant and aesthetically exuberant manner than in this delightfully cynical film. When the proprietor of a sugar cane plantation on an Indonesian island falls to his death after a late-night visit to his housekeeper, mistress, and mother of his illegitimate child, his family is faced with unprecedented trials, including a workers' revolt and a society and place that had never truly embraced their presence. Examining history with a clearly skewed and meta perspective, Sweet Dreams unravels the toxic nature of an unethical exploitation system with intelligence and style, in this ironic and penetrating social thriller, becoming a bizarre yet exceptional cinematic gem.—Thessaloniki International Film Festival</p>

                            <p>Description: You can control a man for a time with brute violence, but you can never truly OWN a man until he's convinced that your word is law, and he must obey - and is virtuous for doing so. A film destined to be a cult classic, "Jones Plantation" is the vanguard film of the American Dissident Cinema movement.</p>

                            <p>Description: The movie takes place in Cincinnati OH. The movie opens with tension running high as a black woman is stopped by three white police officers. After arguing for a moment that black woman named Latasha Crawford is shoved to the ground. After being shoved to the ground we later see in the movie she died due to head injuries. This leads to the black community leading a protest in her name and shouting Justice for Latasha. The leader of the protest was her friend and poet Micah King. Micah is very angry at police officers and is leading the community to retaliate like Malcom X but he is switched with a white police officer just like in freaky Friday He wakes up as a white police officer and the officer wakes up black. The two of them soon realize what it is like to walk in other peoples shoes and learn to grow empathy for each other. The two characters bond before switching back and now their outlook on the protest is completely different. Now Micah sees that not all police officers are bad and if they want to achieve true justice it will take everyone black and white working together.—Cam Marshall</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are catering the Elk Park society wedding of the year, the bride, groom and many of their friends in the wedding party with who they went to school. The bride is Jessamyn, Tom's ex-wife, who Goldy is not surprised to find is the ultimate bridezilla. The groom is equally wealthy Sterling, whose family left town after high school. The maid of honor and best man are Katy, who used to date Sterling, and Ray who is Katy's current serious boyfriend. But not all is all right with this union in there being hard feelings between some on either side stemming from a business scam from years ago which some have never forgot or forgiven. On the morning after the rehearsal dinner, one key member of the wedding is found dead in the wedding venue hotel, and another has gone missing. While Tom starts to investigate, he is pulled from the case due to his association to Jessamyn, with Detective Dave Trach seconded to lead the investigation, Dave and Tom who have a history on many levels which has led to their animosity. Without even needing to ask the other, Tom and Goldy start investigating together, Goldy who has the benefit of knowing many of the players and their history. They nonetheless have to do their work without letting specifically Dave know what they're doing. It becomes more difficult for them, but especially Tom, when Dave places Tom on the top of his suspect list, part of that accusation based on their history.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Marine biologist Dr. Juniper Jones, a self-admitted introvert, has never stayed in one place for long, preferring to see the world, thus needing to make the most of her time in each locale. In the approach to Christmas, she, currently in Amsterdam, plans to head to Scandinavia for the holidays to see the northern lights, before heading on to her next assignment in South Africa. However, she answers the call of her best friend, Candice Adams of the Mystic Aquarium in Mystic, Connecticut, to work at the aquarium, in the current absence of a head marine biologist, solely to oversee the imminent release of what was an injured harbor seal before she heads off to South Africa on December 26th. Going to Mystic is despite learning that Candice's brother, Sawyer Adams, still lives there. Only having met once ten years ago at Candice's wedding, Juniper and Sawyer had a memorable couple of days until miscommunication led to them breaking contact with each other. While Juniper and Sawyer still think about the other, they blame the other for the way things ended between the two of them. Unlike Juniper, Sawyer, who owns his own pizza parlor, talks often about seeing the world, but his knowledge of the world is largely limited to Google as he feels it is never a good time to leave Mystic. Juniper and Sawyer's reunion is a cordial but cautious one in each not liking confrontation. The question then becomes if the two can overcome their differences to make a relationship work, those differences which still do include what happened between them ten years ago for them to break contact.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Henry Sugar (Benedict Cumberbatch) is the pseudonym of a miserly bachelor who uses his inherited fortune to fund his gambling habits. Henry is 41 years old who inherited his fortune from his rich father. He was too selfish to share the fortune with anyone, hence never married. He had a taste for clothes, was tall, but not particularly handsome. He drove a Ferrari, which cost the same as a country cottage.
Henry just wanted to make himself richer. Some buys stocks and share. Some buy art or diamonds. Some gamble. Henry was a gambler and not above cheating.Henry visited his friend William W and spent time at his library, which was filled with leather bound volumes of books from floor to ceiling. Henry notices a particular book in the collection, which looked out of place.He comes across a book of a doctor ZZ Chatterjee's (Dev Patel) 1935 report of Imdad Khan (Ben Kingsley), a man who claimed he could see and interact without using his eyes.
Imdad announced himself to Dr Chatterjee on 2nd Dec 1935, in Calcutta, and asked to be subjected to any manner of tests to validate his claim. Imdad was 61 years old, with white hair and a white mustache.
Imdad says that he travels with a circus and every time the circus visits a new town, He undergoes the same test at the biggest hospital of that town.
Chatterjee glues Imdad's eyelids and then covers it with dough and then bandages the entire face to make sure Imdad cannot see anything. Imdad walks confident out of the hospital and in to the streets. Imdad took a bicycle and rode away.After watching Imdad perform even greater feats in his own circus act, the doctor interviewed Imdad, and he tells him his life history. Imdad was born in Kashmir in 1873. In 1886, Imdad joined the circus and saved Rs 3000. As a young runaway in a traveling circus, he sought out a guru known as The Great Yogi (Richard Ayoade), who could meditate while levitating his own body. Imdad traveled to the town near the Ganges and hired a horse cart to travel to the jungle. His travelling companion turned out to be a disciple of the Yogi. The disciple disappeared once he learned that Imdad was seeking the Yogi, but Imdad had kept an eye on him and followed him through the jungle. Eventually, Imdad reaches a clearing with 2 huts in it.Imdad hid in a tree and saw the Yogi levitate with his own eyes. Imdad reveals himself to the Yogi. Yogi wanted to fling a brick at Imdad, but is immediately remorseful at his actions.
Reluctantly, he taught him his meditation method, which gained Imdad his abilities. Imdad was 17 years old when he started mediating. In 5 years, he was able to concentrate for 1.5 minutes. By 1907, when he was 34 years old. He could concentrate for 3 minutes without wandering his mind. By this time, he could start to visualize the outline of objects in front of him, without opening his eyes. For the next 8 years Imdad perfected his technique to read playing cards, charts and maps by keeping himself blindfolded. By 1915, he had perfected it.
But the public never believed him.Though Imdad died overnight before the doctors could further study him. Chatterjee saw Imdad as a medical miracle. Imdad could lead to blind gaining sight, or the deaf hearing. The possibilities were endless.
Chatterjee carefully recorded everything Imdad said and bound it into a book for safe keeping.By practicing Imdad's meditations for three years Henry manages to see through playing cards. Henry follows Imdad's instructions perfectly and makes much more rapid progress. He gradually reduces the time needed to read through cards from 1 minute to 5 seconds.
Henry uses these abilities at a casino and makes £30,000 at blackjack. Henry learns how to lose occasionally so as not to attract attention of the patrons.Henry got back home and suddenly realize that he did not want all this money that he had earned so easily. He could be the richest man in the world if he wanted.
Unsatisfied with his ease in earning money, he throws them off his balcony into the streets of London. Since he nearly caused a riot, the police suggest that he find a more legal form of charity like giving it to an orphanage or a charity.He decides to travel worldwide, winning money with his abilities under varying disguises and to establishing a network of successful hospitals and orphanages. Within a year he had already won 120 million pounds. Henry accumulated all the money in Switzerland, which was tax free.
Two decades later, Henry dies at the age of 63 from a pulmonary embolism which he knew would cause his death. He had accumulated 644 million pounds. He had left behind 21 well established children's hospitals and orphanages all over the world. His accountant John Winston commissions Roald Dahl (Ralph Fiennes) to write on his story under the pseudonym Henry Sugar.
Roald completed the story in 1976.</p>

                            <p>Description: Life is unpredictable. Love is complicated. But change is possible if you're willing to do the work. Behind the Veil is a heart-wrenching story about love, marriage, betrayal, addiction, and suffering. Stacey is a successful woman trapped by the image of success. Darrel is a strong man battling his own demons in private. They are models of hope in their community but carrying pain in their heart. Together they teach us that marriage won't heal what you refuse to reveal, and love won't fix what lust broke.—Mya Speller Cullins</p>

                            <p>Description: Roger (Thiago Martins) was a promising racer, but in recent times, he has been repeatedly defeated by Debora. Considered the queen of truck racing, Debora (Sheron Menezzes) was basking in her glory while Roger tried to come up with a solution to confirm his win.When Roger and his best friend cum coach, Danilo (Raphael Logam), discussed the truck repair, Roger was confident that his old man would find a solution. The next morning, when his father bailed him from the police station after a case of drunk driving, he was not happy with Roger's conduct. He blamed Roger for destroying the racing team that he had built over the years and called him out for his bratty behavior.
After their heated argument, Roger got out of the car and challenged his father to watch him win the next time. While his father was busy arguing with him, a truck came out of nowhere and hit the car. Roger's father died on the spot, and soon Roger learned that the racing team had gone bankrupt. Roger was now responsible for the welfare of his teammates, and he was desperate to find a way to clear the debts. Roger was hopeful that his sponsors would step in, but to his dismay, they backed out.With no other options in hand, Roger decided to have a word with Odilon (Evandro Mesquita). Odilon was a gangster, and Roger's father owed money to him. The old-school gangster suggested Roger clear some of the debts and earn extra cash by working for him. He had some tasks lined up, and he needed a pilot. Roger was a little hesitant at first, but due to a lack of an alternative, he agreed to it. He was introduced to Odilon's man, Smokey (Milhem Cortaz), who briefed him about the task. Roger brought Danilo on board to help him carry out the operations. Danilo had a daughter to look after, and with the company going into bankruptcy, he decided to step up as well. Roger and Danilo's task was to hijack electronic cargo truck on the road and pass it to Smokey's man, Sketch, to distribute the goods in the city.
Every truck has a device, which if triggered by the driver will lock the truck down. So, the best way to take control of the truck is to talk to the driver and bribe him off. The insurance covers the company's losses. But all cargo trucks are tracked, and the insurance company calls the cops as soon as the truck deviates from its route. They have 15 minutes to reach their unloading site.After completing the first task, Roger and Danilo proposed ways to ensure that they remained untraceable during the course of the task. Knowing that Roger had no sponsors, Debora was a little surprised to see Roger win. She could not help but wonder how he was managing the expenses of his team. While Roger explained that he received money from selling his father's shop, Debora was not ready to believe him.Danilo came up with a way to hijack cargo without blocking the path of the driver. They faced complications during the operation when the brakes on the cargo stopped working, leaving Danilo in a life-threatening position. Roger stepped up and managed to bring the situation under control. Just when Danilo and Roger thought that the worst bit was over, they suddenly came across a police car and policemen blocking the road. While Roger wanted to hit the brakes and surrender, Danilo advised him to keep driving. The police fired at the truck, and Danilo was shot as a result.
Danilo succumbed to the bullet wounds, and Roger was left with the responsibility of taking care of Danilo's fourteen-year-old daughter. Losing his best friend left Roger in a state of anguish. He decided to reach out to social services to handle Barbara's situation, but she was vehemently against it. She instead suggested that they find her only living relative, her grandmother, on Facebook and come up with a suitable arrangement. But until then, Barbara demanded to stay at Roger's place, and Roger agreed to her proposal.Meanwhile, Roger's ex-sponsor, Toledo, returned after watching Roger win the last few races. He agreed to sponsor Roger once again, and Roger felt a sense of relief. He had a sponsor, and he no longer needed to conduct the dirty business of Odilon and Smokey, but they were not ready to let go of him so easily. Barbara joins Roger's command crew at the next race and helps him time his power thrusts to keep the engine from overheating and to beat Debora.After not responding to Smokey's calls, his man, Sketch, was at Roger's doorstep, threatening him to respond. While Roger made it clear to Smokey that he wanted to step away, there was no easy way of doing so. Roger was compelled to take up the job, but it did not go as planned. Roger once again expressed how he was not interested in working for him, but Smokey was not ready to take no for an answer.
Smokey kills Toledo and sends a message to Roger to do what he is told.Meanwhile, police officer Alfonso (Paulo Vilhena), who had been keeping a close watch on Roger, warned him that the police knew about his activities. Alfonso had tracked Smokey's call to Roger and knew where the next job was going down. Alfonso intercepts the truck with his forces, but Roger and Sketch barely manage to escape by hiding inside a Favella and disposing of the cargo there.Alfonso had evidence to arrest Roger, but instead, he wanted Roger to cooperate with the police and trap Smokey and Odilon. Not only was Roger in trouble with the police and the gangsters, but he also learned that Barbara had been lying to him about her grandmother. After digging into her background, he found out that both her grandmothers had passed away. Barbara was not ready to start her life anew, and she believed Roger was the only person who was somewhat close to being her parent. But for Roger, the entire situation was a problem, considering that he was sheltering a teenager without any proper documents, and he could easily land up in more trouble. Just after their conflict the previous night, Roger found out that Smokey had kidnapped Barbara to blackmail him to do the job.Roger had no other choice but to agree to the last job that Smokey wanted him to be a part of. The final job was extremely risky, with Smokey planning to target a police convoy and rob their container full of weapons. Roger protested the minute he heard the plan, but he was completely helpless. Roger sought comfort in Debora since she was the only person he had confided in about his situation.
Roger has worked out a plan to make the perfect arrest. Roger initially performed according to Smokey's plan, and he was successful in getting the container of weapons and bringing it to Smokey. Roger demanded that he free Barbara, and Smokey obliged. After Barbara was handed over to Debora, Roger got on the truck and started to drive it. Smokey watched him escape with the container, and in the meantime, Roger called Odilon and warned him that the cops had arrived at the meet-up point and had Smokey and his men. Roger left his phone attached to the container, and eventually, Smokey and his gang arrived at the location. The police had also been tracking Roger, and they had reached the warehouse as well.After a shootout, the police arrested Smokey and his men. Meanwhile, Roger was back on track after conducting the operation. With Barbara's help, he won the race. Barbara was just as talented as her father, and Roger was proud of her. Soon after winning the race, Alfonso arrived to make the arrests. Odilon did not expect to be fooled by Roger, and he was ultimately taken away by the police. Roger, too, was arrested for his involvement, and he was not bitter about it, knowing that he deserved to be punished for choosing the wrong path. After serving his two-year sentence, Roger was released from prison. Debora and Barbara came to receive him. Even though they were extremely competitive on track, Debora and Roger were in love. Also, Debora managed to get permanent custody of Barbara, and the three together became one happy family in the end.</p>

                            <p>Description: Atlanta has a new police chief, Eric St. John. He's from LA and first issue at hand is to investigate the murders of Tru Hawkins and Nadine Markes. He has a personal interest. Saint has left LA and the corruption behind to find a new home in Atlanta under a new Mayor. He is granted the green light to investigate the 7-year-old murders and to help clean up the city of Atlanta. Crime is on the rise in the city and Buckhead is threatening to become its own municipality. The new mayor leans on Saint to clean up the dirty streets that Saint himself has helped to create. Six returns on the 7th anniversary of his brothers murder. He quickly learns that his brothers murder may be due to his personal transgressions. Andre has tried to change his life by submitting himself to the Muslim faith. After learning that Six has returned to town, his blood begins to boil as the memories of deceit and betrayal play in his mind. Andre is more than willing to destroy the city to complete the task of removing Six permanently from the world. These three men navigate The Streets of Atlanta to find answers to their questions. Through twists and turns of misinformation and solid leads, all three men will move heaven and Earth to get to the truth. Six's mother reminds him that you cannot live a dirty life and expect to clean ending. Six reassures her that he will avenge the death of his brother and make rights the things that he has done wrong in this world to create such a travesty. Andre talks to his therapist and without avail returns to the life that he once knew not just to remove six but to turn him into the authorities for all that he has done against humanity. The spiral begins and terminates when all three men come face to face in an abandoned warehouse.</p>

                            <p>Description: Dana Randall (Delta Goodrem) is the pilot for the tiny Queensland company which aids people in the remote area, both for the people living there and for visiting tourists. Her dad Jeff (Roy Billing) chides her for blowing off high-paying visitors to transport a resident's dog (who had been bitten by a snake and would die if it did not receive timely medical care) to the vet, as their bills are mounting.William Mitchell (Joshua Sasse) is sent all the way from London by ITCM Financial, his father Duncan's (Hugh Parker) UK investment firm, to the tropics of Australia to shut down Fullerton Airways. He'd researched companies they have been backing, and pinpoints the small, flailing, family-run seaplane business as ideal for liquidation as it lacks income. He's given a week to visit the company, go over their financial in person and return to the board meeting to shut them down, proving to his father he's ready to move up in the company.
Duncan says that if William does a good job, he will be made Junior Director at the company.Nikki (Steph Tisdell), Fullerton's airplane mechanic, pushes Dana to find time to date but she insists she's too busy. Dana is dedicated to keeping Fullerton airways going as this was her dead mother's vision and wish.
The next morning, Jeff warns them a rep from ITCM Financial is coming for an inspection. Dana is asked to pick up Will from the ferry, and initially they have a testy relationship. Jeff goes out of his way to try and impress William.
She is quick to defend their remote air support, although Jeff tries to downplay it. William says that Government subsidizes the cost of fuel for the remote air support flights. But since Fullerton Airways has only one operational plane, it doesn't leave much room for profits.Dana whizzes Will around to a community off the coast of far-north Queensland to deliver parcels to people in need, which she visits every two weeks as otherwise they'd be totally cut off. The plane is 52 years old, and William is claustrophobic.
Again, they convince him to accompany her on her rounds a second day. This time the engine kicks out, but luckily Dana manages to keep her cool and lands the plane safely. She fixes the problem and the plane flies again.Afterwards, having drinks in Fullerton, Dana's ex Heath (Simon Brook McLachlan) sees her chemistry with Will and both he and Nikki encourage her to pursue him. So, they spend time together while crossing the tarmac, stargazing and sharing stories about their lives. Dana shares how much her family, and she are connected with the community. This is her purpose is life.A third day of helping Dana, and Will's father loses patience with him. William was supposed to have audited the financial by now, but he hadn't even started yet, as he was busy helping Dana.
Will tries to convince Duncan that they were wrong to want to write off the small aeronautical company, but Nikki overhears. Dana is chewing out over the news when confirmation of an impending cyclone reaches them.Will helps Dana find an injured Jeff, who'd been trying to help others seek safety against the cyclone. The three-person staff of Fullerton Airways hole up with Will in the hangar's storage room to wait out the storm. He pledges to fight for their company at his headquarters, as he cares about Dana.The next morning, after the storm has passed, Will helps Dana deliver emergency supplies to many remote locations. Working hard all day, by nightfall she has made peace with him. However, as they're closing up the hanger for the night, Jeff announces that ITCM Financial has sent an e-mail, shutting them down immediately.William has returned to London and has been unsuccessful in swaying the board. Dana arrives unannounced, armed with a plan to revamp and expand Fullerton Airways. In response to Duncan's negative response, Will resigns and offers himself to Dana to aid them in their expansion.ITCM Financial backs their endeavor, and Fullerton Airways is shown to have expanded and now has a more professional look, with Will happily installed there with the company and Dana, as the two had fallen for each other.</p>

                            <p>Description: In Kalimpong, Maya D'Souza (Kareena Kapoor Khan) is a divorced, single mother who works at a cafeteria. Naren Vyas (Jaideep Ahlawat) is a reclusive, but brilliant mathematics teacher, who lives next door to Maya and Tara (Naisha Khanna) (Maya's daughter).
Through a gap in the wall, Naren can peep into Maya's apartment and see everything that is going on in their lives.Naren is solemn and introverted, and his morning exchanges with Maya from whose cafeteria he buys lunch, is the brightest part of his day. Maya's colleague at the cafeteria tells her that Naren only comes to the cafeteria when Maya is at the counter. She says that Naren has a crush on Maya.
Ajit (Saurabh Sachdeva), Maya's abusive ex-husband, shows up one night to extort money from Maya, threatening both her and Tara. Ajit has found Maya after 14 years and it is implied that Maya is not her real name, she had changed it from Soniya to protect her whereabouts from Ajit.
Ajit follows Maya home, who gives him whatever little money she has. Maya wants Ajit gone as soon as possible. Ajit wants to take Tara and push her into the prostitution business, just like Maya was before.
The situation quickly escalates into violence and Ajit is killed by mother and daughter on the apartment floor.Overhearing the commotion from his room and deducing that Ajit has been killed, Naren offers his help to the mother and daughter. He not only disposes the body, but also plots the cover-up step-by-step. The evidence shows that Maya strangled Ajit with a wire, while Tara grabbed his hands by her nails, so he could not save himself. He sanitizes the heating rod wire that was used to kill Ajit and also the entire apartment. Ajit was staying at hotel Alice Villa, and had paid for 3 days, 2 days ago. So, Naren says that they have 1 day before his absence is reported.
Naren says that since Ajit was in the police, someone will come looking for him.
Naren asks Maya and Tara to create an evidence trail for themselves.When the body turns up and is identified, Inspector Karan Anand (Vijay Varma), who was initially investigating the disappearance of Ajit and happens to be the former classmate of Naren, draws the case and Maya comes under suspicion. Ajit was suspected to be a major money launderer for the mafia and was in the police himself. A strip club owner tells Karan that Ajit had come in a week ago and was talking about a lottery in Kalimpong.
Karan reaches Kalimpong and has coffee at Maya's cafe. Maya says that she has not seen Ajit.Karan finds Ajit's luggage in hotel Alice Villa. He finds that Ajit was looking for a school. Karan finds Maya there talking to Tara. Karan checks out Maya's connection to Ajit. Naren tells Maya that Karan will come for her. Naren asks her to pretend that Ajit is still alive. He says that Ajit's body will never be found.
Karan finds a deeply charred body in the jungle with Ajit's ID next to it. The body has no fingerprints or teeth. The body had traces of blood on the clothes, and blood matches DNA samples picked from Ajit's room. Karan concludes that the body belongs to Ajit. He died at around 7 pm.Karan meets Maya at her house and this time she says that Ajit was her husband. She doesn't want Ajit anywhere near her daughter. She says Ajit came to Kalimpong to ask her for money. Maya says that Ajit married her and then sold her to Paradise strip club.
Maya says that on the day of Ajit's murder at 7 PM she was watching a movie at Capitol Cinema with Tara. They had dinner after that, and then Karaoke. They left home around 5:30 PM and returned at 11 PM.Karan is unable to find any obvious holes in Maya's manufactured alibi, but he is still sure that there is something wrong with her alibi, a suspicion that he cannot shake. Karan says that the night of the murder was Thursday and Tara had school the next day. Why would Maya keep her out till 11 PM in that scenario.
Karan questions Tara as well, but she was also well prepared by Naren. Naren never mat Maya or Tara in person, but kept in touch with them on their landline, via a payphone outside his Dojo.Karan finds out that the dead body had strangle marks on the neck and blunt injury at the back of the head. His colleague says that both injuries look like that from a coil water heater.
Karan lures Maya out of the house and his colleagues enters the house behind her to take the coil heater for analysis. But the coil heater does not match the patterns found on the dead body. It is not the murder weapon.Karan is about to close the case and leave Kalimpong, when he learns from Maya's colleague at the cafe that Naren is Maya's only friend in the city. Naren had hidden this information from Karan.
Naren was on leave on the day of the murder. For the first time in 10 years of service.
Karan is convinced that Naren had something to do with the murder, leading towards a dangerous cat-and-mouse game between the two.
Karan tries to rile Naren by implying that Karan had a mutually lustful connect with Maya. But Naren plays it cool.
Naren meets Maya and tells her to stay out of the matter, no matter what happens.The next day Naren admits to Karan that he killed Ajit. He says that he is Maya's bodyguard and he killed Ajit because he knew never wanted to see him again. Naren described step by step how he lured Ajit to an isolated area, strangled him, bashed his face and burnt his body.
Naren is adamant that Maya was asking for his help through the gap in their walls, while she was pretending to talk to Tara. Naren appears as mentally deranged. Maya, of course, says that she knows nothing.
Naren says that he is revealing all this as Maya betrayed him with Karan. Karan finds the murder weapon in Naren's bathroom. His internet search history had instructions on how to dispose a body.Towards the end, both Naren's scheme and the reason for his devotion to Maya are revealed: Naren had lost his will to live due to his depression and was prepared to commit suicide when he was interrupted by Maya introducing herself, leading him to become deeply attached to her and thankful for her unknowingly saving his life.
Naren had solved a math problem after 10 years of hard work and then found that someone else had solved it 2 days ago. This was the reason for his depression and attempted suicide.In order to deceive the investigation, Naren murdered a second person, a homeless man who he had seen prior on his commute to work, and made the police believe he was Ajit, in order to obfuscate the date and time of the murder by 24 hours and make it so that in the end he could take the fall.Naren eventually confesses to the crime to protect Maya and pretends to be mentally unstable. He is imprisoned and he spends his time in prison solving a complex mathematics problem.</p>

                            <p>Description: Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla) were quite good at playing online games, and they spend most of their time doing that, which is why their parents, Terrence Tango (Zachary Levi) and Nora Torrez (Gina Rodriguez), had some strict rules in place. Terrence has these rules as Terence and Nora are spies and their computers host the top-secret Armageddon code, and they are afraid that someone might use their kids' computers to hack into their network and steal the Armageddon code.
Both spies are told by their boss Devlin that unknown assailants are trying to break into OSS servers to get to the Armageddon code.Tony and Patty were allowed to play games at a specified time during the day and for not more than a couple of hours. But that didn't stop Tony from sneaking out in the middle of the night and playing games with his sister. Patty didn't like it when they broke the rules, as she was the kind of person who believed that staying honest in one's life was of utmost importance. Tony didn't believe that, as he always said that one should have their way by hook or by crook. Patty tried to make him understand that maybe he benefited from speaking lies, but ultimately, he would have to pay the price for it. Tony took part in a competition organized by a gaming company that had created a game called Hyscore.As a prize for winning the competition, Tony got the game Hyscore, which hadn't been released up until then, installed on his computer. Tony had won the competition by cheating, but he was happy because he had gotten the desired result. In the night, both the kids came out and decided that they would check out how the game was. Tony's father used to change the password so that his kids weren't able to access any games after the prescribed hours. But Tony had found the password, and he used it to log in to the game. But as soon as the game started, the screen started flickering, and the device shut down. The kids didn't understand what was happening, so they immediately ran to their bedroom before their parents came and caught them red-handed.The creator of the game, Rey "The King" Kingston (Billy Magnussen), had deceived Tony, and he had entered the system to steal the Armageddon code. That code was used by OSS agents to enter any device, and Rey knew that if he was able to get his hands on it, he would be able to rule the whole world and make people act according to his wishes.
Meanwhile, Terrence and Nora were having an argument about whether they should delete the Armageddon code, as they knew that if it fell into the wrong hands, it would not be good for the world. Terrence was against it as he argued that they have used the code themselves to hack strongly protected systems, but Nora made him unconscious and went to delete it.But before she could do that, Rey hacked the system and stole the Armageddon code. Soon, there was widespread chaos all over, and the game Hyscore, got installed on the devices of half of the world. Terrence came back to his senses, but the character of the game, Hyscore, waged an all-out attack at their residence. Terrence and Nora were able to send their kids to the safe house, but they couldn't escape and were taken into custody by Rey King Kingston. Nora gives Patty her locket before she got separated from them.Terrence had divided the Armageddon code into two halves, and that is why Rey was only able to hack into half of the devices in the world. He had realized that the second half of the code was in the locket that Patty wore, so he sent his men to kidnap the kids and bring them to his hideout.
In the meantime, Patty and Tony had figured out all the gadgets in the hideout and had trained themselves to be effective spies.
The hideout is found by OSS agents who bring the kids to Devlin. The kids unlock Devlin's systems and tell him that Ray Kingston is their suspect. Ray's goons attack the OSS HQ where Devlin had brought the kids. They steal the Armageddon code from the kids and escape via boats on the lake. The kids follow them using OSS gadgets. They find the location of their parents by reverse tracker Nora's tracker and fly there is a jet.Terrence, meanwhile, told Nora that the Armageddon code had been created by him, but Tony, the little boy, didn't even know about it.
Terrence said that during the fireball mission, in which they killed Vargos and destroyed his laboratory, he had procured a blueprint for a weapon that Vargos had been making. Terrence knew that if he was able to understand that blueprint, he could use it to make a code through which they could break into any kind of device. But Terrence was never able to understand it fully, but one fine day, Tony entered his room, and thinking that it was a puzzle, he solved it.It is revealed that Rey Kingston was Vargos' son, and he believed that his father was trying to make the world a better place through his creations when the OSS team arrived and killed him in cold blood. Even Patty believed that Terrence and Nora could have found a way where they wouldn't have to kill everyone. She actually told her parents what they could have done in order to bring the situation under control without hurting anyone, and Terrence and Nora were a bit taken aback as it made sense, and surprisingly, it had never occurred to them.After the death of his father, Rey believed that the people of the world didn't deserve to be treated nicely. He wanted to bring about a change by hacking into their devices and making them act according to his wishes. What Terrence and Nora had believed to be their victory was actually their biggest failure, and their own daughter made them realize that. Terrence, Nora, and even Tony understood that what Patty was saying made sense and that for being a spy, they didn't necessarily have to be dishonest in their approach.Tony and Patty reached Rey Kingston's hideout, where they met their parents and took them out of the holding cell. But Rey was already a step ahead of them, and before they could do anything, he used the Armageddon code chip and initiated the process of hacking into the devices of the entire population of planet Earth.A countdown started, and Tony knew he had to do something about it before it was too late. He found the place where the main system was kept, and he did everything that he could to stop the countdown. But he realized that he was deceived by the King, as he had unknowingly armed the system. That's when the King arrived and told them they had been duped, and now he was going to wreak havoc on the world. Rey Kingston left the scene with a VR pod, and that's when Patty realized that if they could enter the game and stop Rey, then they could save the world.
They knew that Rey was controlling everything from inside the game, and all they needed was to find a way to defeat him. Terrence and Nora, in the direction of their kids, sat on the VR pods, and all four of them entered the virtual world of Hyscore. From Heck Knight to the King, the family faced every lethal villain who was a part of the game verse. Patty had requested everyone to play with all fairness, even if others resorted to dishonest means.It seemed like the King would defeat Tony, but Tony's honesty paid off, and he received an extra life, which was a sort of fair play award that was rarely given to the players. Tony defeated Rey, and Patty asked the OSS not to arrest him but to send him back into the virtual world so that he could become a better man.
The generosity and honesty of the kids moved Rey, and he realized that to change the world, he didn't have to resort to such cruel means and methods. The kids were called by Devlin (D. J. Cotrona) to the OSS office the next day, and he told them they were also being officially recruited as spies. Devlin promised that he would bring about a change in the spy manual and not tell his agents to resort to unfair means. It all ended well for the Spy family, and probably, in the next installment, we will see them taking up more missions and saving the world from crises.</p>

                            <p>Description: Only the few members of Yellow Door have seen fellow member Bong Joon-ho's directorial debut film Looking for Paradise, which was never released. This stop-motion animation about a gorilla leaving a dark and dirty basement to escape the attacks of dung bugs and heading to paradise was screened at an end-of-the-year party for Yellow Door members. When the wooden box containing the 8mm film hidden deep in Bong's study for thirty years is opened, cinephiles' memories of the early 1990s will come flooding back as well. In the era of film enthusiasts, when everyone was mad about studying film, Yellow Door was their own cinematheque and film school, and above all, an ideal youth community.</p>

                            <p>Description: Brynn is a seamstress still living in her childhood home who mourns the loss of her mother and best friend, Maude. She copes with these losses by constructing a model town in her living room. A past event appears to have turned the entire town against Brynn, so she leads an anxious, solitary and withdrawn life. One night she awakens to discover an intruder in her home and quickly realizes the intruder is a humanoid alien. Brynn attempts to escape but is stalked by the intruder. When the alien uses telekinesis to subdue her, Brynn accidentally stabs it in the head with the broken fragment of her model town's school bell tower, causing it to release Brynn.Brynn discovers all electronic devices were rendered useless after the alien's intrusion. She abandons her car and the alien's body before heading into town. She passes her neighbor's ransacked house and an overturned mail van as she makes her way to the police station. At the station, Brynn unexpectedly encounters Maude's parents, who happen to be the chief of police and his wife. Maude's mother looks at Brynn with contempt, spits in her face, and walks out of the station. Brynn decides to flee, but as she rides a bus leaving town, several passengers attempt to restrain her, all of whom are possessed by other aliens, and chase her. She comes across a deserted church and visits Maude's grave, only to spot a group of people who appear to be under the influence of small tentacled creatures that slither visibly beneath the skin of their throats. At Brynn's home that evening, a glowing light carries the alien's corpse out of her house and Brynn is forced to fend off two more creatures. After an intermittent fight with a smaller alien, Brynn impales it through a wardrobe with a broken mop handle and slams the wardrobe door on its head.Brynn flees her home but is caught and dragged by an alien-controlled man to a flying saucer's tractor beam. However, just as she is about to be raised into the craft, she kicks the man into the tractor beam and runs away. The third and much larger alien stalks and attacks Brynn, eventually climbing over her house to catch her. She leads it into her station wagon, where its long limbs become trapped in the unfamiliar cabin. One of its feet punctures the gas tank, which Brynn ignites. A flying saucer extinguishes the flames with a ray but the creature is burned to death.After running back into her home, a humanoid alien telekinetically throws her through a wall and she is restrained with a red ray. The alien levitates and regurgitates a tentacled creature, which forcibly enters Brynn's mouth. Brynn immediately falls into an intense hallucination in which her home is undamaged and her best friend, Maude, is still alive, but she breaks free of her hallucination and tears the tentacled creature from her mouth. The alien summons a flying saucer and it levitates the tentacled creature and causes it rapidly to grow a body double of Brynn. The Brynn-double chases the real Brynn into the woods.The Brynn-double catches Brynn and stabs her, but she kills it with a boxcutter and escapes to a deserted road. There she encounters a huge alien before being sucked into a flying saucer. Inside, Brynn is mentally pushed into memories by a group of humanoid aliens, forcing her to remember the event that turned her entire town against her. During an argument in a field, Brynn is knocked to the ground by Maude, and she strikes Maude in the head with the stone, killing her. The aliens converse with one another and return Brynn to Earth without a tentacled organism controlling her actions.Sometime later, Brynn lives in her undamaged home. Every other resident of her town is now evidently under control of the aliens and yet, in a stark reversal of Brynn's life before the invasion, the townspeople are quite neighborly with her.</p>

                            <p>Description: Tanhaji Malusare, a revered warrior and commander under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, held the title of Subhedar. Despite being known for his legendary battle at Sinhagad, this film highlights his contributions to Swarajya. From overseeing the construction of Sindhudurg sea-fort amid treacherous conditions to building roads in Tal Kokan during the Sangameshwar conflict, the movie showcases his invaluable service. By portraying these aspects, the film pays homage to Tanhaji's sacrifice and his significant role in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Swarajya, culminating in the epic Battle of Sinhagad.—Visual Junkies</p>

                            <p>Description: Itsy Levan is devastated by her parents' decision to leave the city and buy a fixer-upper in the middle of nowhere. Her life seems over until she meets her space-obsessed neighbor Calvin Kipler, who believes that his parents were abducted by aliens 10 years ago on the night Jesper's comet was seen. Itsy sees this as her chance to get into a New York City journalism program by writing an exposé on Calvin, but she ends up discovering much more than what's on the other end of the comet's tail.</p>

                            <p>Description: Estranged from her husband Jason (Steven Good), Sonja (Chelsea Gilligan) finds comfort in her boss, Robert (Austen Jaye). When Robert is found dead at a hotel, his wife, Mia, (Sydney Cole Alexander), is devastated, especially when she uncovers that he was having an affair. As Mia leaves Robert's office following his death, she recognizes Sonja's perfume when they pass by each other. After learning that Robert has died, Sonja takes it as a sign to give her marriage another chance. Hoping to reconnect, Jason rents a remote cabin where a woman named Clare introduces herself as their neighbor. Slowly reconnecting, Sonja leaves Jason alone in the cabin to head back into the city for a work emergency. While Sonja is away, a thunderstorm hits the cabin, and Clare shows up on Jason's doorstep claiming her power is out. Jason invites Clare inside for shelter, but when she kisses him, he remains faithful to Sonja. When Sonja returns to the cabin, she is immediately suspicious of Clare. Determined to uncover what Clare is really up to, Sonja sneaks into her home where she is caught by Clare, who reveals her true identity as Mia. Realizing how far Mia is willing to go for revenge, Sonja must stop Mia before she loses everything she cares about.—Jakkepoes</p>

Before long, Milton develops a close relationship with the extra-terrestrial he calls "Jules." Things become complicated when two neighbors (Harris and Curtin) discover Jules and the government quickly closes in. What follows is a funny, wildly inventive ride as the three neighbors find meaning and connection later in life - thanks to this unlikely stranger.—Bleecker Street</p>

                            <p>Description: The church, respect for your elders and community are very strong themes in the lives of Tongan people. These values don't diminish when they emigrate to live in another country. In some ways the need for a cohesive community in a foreign land makes these themes more important as they adopt new cultural morals and incorporate work and leisure activities into their new lives.
In 2011 the Rugby Union World Cup was held in New Zealand for the second time. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) urges the people to support all teams with as much fervor as they would the New Zealand national team. Rugby is one of the leisure activities Tongan youngsters play in bare feet with a rolled up jersey for a ball, now there is a World Cup with two powerhouse teams, New Zealand and France, in the same pool as Tonga. It is an opportunity for all Tongans to showcase their proud warrior spirit and culture on a world stage.
Maka and Veni are determined to go to the game to be held between France and Tonga in their hometown at the Wellington stadium that is commonly referred to as "The cake tin" because of its shape. Maka is the typical comic family member who has lots of dreams but does not put in the work to make them come true, Veni is younger, has a good job, but does not speak Tongan. Maka tries to make money for tickets through cultural performances and donations, when this does not work Veni tries to buy a ticket for himself which is really not the Tongan way, nor the Polynesian way. Maka tries to buy tickets that turn out to be counterfeit and just brings him further shame and disdain from his parents and family members. They are left with no tickets and no way to see the game live. The Wellington council and the NZRU want the Rugby World Cup to be a celebration of cultures within the rugby community so they offer Maka and Venis church group an opportunity to perform before the match against France with free tickets on the halfway line for performers and family members. Maka tries to enlist the help of the church group to makeup a Brass band to perform before the game. Church members are skeptical of Makas ability but true to his dreamer spirit he persists. Makas mother rescues a newly arrived Tongan immigrant from some would be gangster Polynesians and Maka and Veni find he played the coronet in a band back in Tonga so they have a teacher. As they progress in the 4 weeks they have to find and learn band instruments they learn a lot about themselves while still satisfying the church, their parents and their community.
This is a very wholesome family movie; there was not one swearword. There is no love interest or romance. It touches on a lot of family issues and connections to culture that are common to a lot of cultures. The story itself, while simple, is very funny, touching and well made. It moves along at a good pace and while the jokes and themes are typically Tongan/Polynesian and sometimes typically New Zealand, they are universally funny and translate well. Some of the Nuances only Polynesians or New Zealanders would pick up on but people in the theatre will still laugh especially the children. In September 2023 Tonga will again feature in the Rugby World Cup to be held in France, but this time Tongan players who have played for other nations are being permitted to play for Tonga. They should be a very strong team.</p>

                            <p>Description: In the late 1960s and 70s, José (Michael Peña) is a young boy whose family (Father Salvador Hernandez (Julio Cesar Cedillo), Brother Beto, mother Julia (Verónica Falcón) and sister Lety) travels from Michoacán as migrant workers picking grapes in California, his parents hoping to buy a house back home after they've made enough money. While they are working in the harvest season, José attends school and works in the fields with his family after.
His teacher, Ms. Young (Michelle Krusiec), notices his potential and visits his parents at home to express her concern over the disruption to his studies by going back and forth as migrant workers.
Jose says that he wants to be an astronaut after he watches he 1969 moon landings on TV.
After his father is only paid partial wages for his work, he realizes José's teacher was right to be concerned and the family decides to stay in California full time.Years later in 1985, José graduates from the University of the Pacific and is hired as an engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab is working on the most sophisticated laser weapon in the world to protect the USA from incoming ballistic nuclear missiles.Salvador never stops reminding Jose how much the whole family has sacrificed for him.
Jose has to bear racial stereotyping at work when he is assumed to be the new janitor by the lab staff. Beto still works in the fields. He is then given menial tasks such as photocopying thousands of documents. Weissberg (Jordan Dean) is Jose's colleague.
Jose has already started applying to NASA and his application has been rejected.Feeling as if he needs to fit in better, he trades in his customized 1963 Chevrolet Impala for a used Mazda RX-7.
While signing the paperwork for the new car, he meets Adela (Rosa Salazar), whom he asks out. After an intimidating first meeting with her family (Adela has a large family and her father insists that he would have to be present for all visits), they see each other more until they marry. They have five kids.
Adela laughs at Jose's goal of wanting to be an astronaut.
Jose finds major flaw in the laser design while photocopying the documents. He brings it to the notice of his supervisor that the Beryllium detector in the laser cannot differentiate between the heat from the laser and the heat from an explosion, hence giving spurious readings.
José continues to work successfully at the lab, now instructing the researchers, including Weissberg, who had previously ignored him.By now Jose has been rejected by NASA 6 times. Adela realizes that Jose is serious about his astronaut dream. She wants him to do what it takes to get selected. Jose says that the last batch of astronauts had 12,962 applicants. The selected batch had many pilots, & high-performance athletes.
Jose trains himself to be a pilot and works on his fitness. He starts diving training, as one of selected had logged more than 700 dives. Many of them speak Russian.
After several years Jose is able to gain proficiency in many of the skills needed for the program.One day during class, José's boss Clint Logan (Eric Johnson) offers him a chance to join a team going to Russia to evaluate a shipment of enriched uranium the United States is looking to purchase for NASA, noting that a trip like that would look really good on an application to the NASA space program. In 1999, Jose travels to Russia and stays there for 6 months.
After several rejections, José hand delivers his 12th application in person to Frederick Sturckow (Garret Dillahunt) who trains incoming astronauts and is a veteran of the Space Shuttle program. He makes a positive impression on Sturckow and is accepted into the program shortly thereafter.José struggles with the training, falling further behind the rest of his class. When he learns of Beto's (Bobby Soto) death in a gang-based shoot-out, he loses focus and is exhorted by Sturckow to catch up with the rest or he may be dismissed from the program. He later has a conversation with the head trainer, Kalpana Chawla (Sarayu Blue), who describes to him why going to space makes all of their hard work worthwhile, and ends by letting him know she's been selected as the Mission Specialist for STS-107 on Space Shuttle Columbia.As José sits with his family watching the broadcast of Columbia's re-entry, they are shaken when news comes in that Columbia didn't survive. Nevertheless, José continues on and begins excelling among his classmates at NASA.
Jose hires a commercial property as location for Adela's Mexican restaurant.In 2008, Sturckow pulls José into a conference room to meet with the selection team, who informs him that he's been chosen to join STS-128 as their Mission Specialist. José visits Adela's restaurant outside the NASA grounds and tells her the news, with his family later watching him at the press conference. He quotes Beto's words to him that it's fitting for a migrant farm-worker to go into the unknowns of space. As he enters quarantine in preparation for the mission, Adela visits him with a surprise: his former teacher Ms. Young, who tells him she's been waiting for this moment for over 30 years, having followed his progress and career, always believing in his enormous potential.The launch day finally arrives, José is prepared along with the rest of the crew who board the shuttle and launch into orbit. After main engine cutoff, José looks around at the shuttle cabin and imagines seeing the same Monarch Butterfly that landed on his dad's arm the day their family decided to stay in California, hinting that he had achieved his destiny.Closing titles note that Mission STS 128 remained on board the International Space Station for 13 days, and that José had tacos and listened to José Alfredo Jiménez's "El Hijo Del Pueblo" while there. José was the first migrant farm-worker in space, and still picks grapes with his father today, albeit in his own vineyard: Tierra Luna Cellars in Lodi, California.</p>

                            <p>Description: In the 18th century, Claude Pinoche, a royalist French soldier, is discovered to be a vampire and survives an attempt to kill him. Witnessing the French Revolution and the execution of Marie Antoinette, he fakes his death and flees abroad, participating in the suppression of revolutionary upheavals over the next centuries. Eventually he ends up in Chile in 1935 and joins the Chilean Army under the name Augusto Pinochet. Rising to become a general, he overthrows the socialist government of Salvador Allende in 1973 and becomes the country's dictator, while demanding that he be addressed as "The Count" by his family. When authorities begin investigating his ill-gotten wealth and human rights abuses after he leaves office, he fakes his death again and retires to a remote farm. After 250 years of existence he gradually loses his will to live, worrying his wife Lucia, and his long-time butler, Fyodor, a white Russian whom Pinochet bit and turned into a vampire.Fyodor takes up Augusto's military uniform and goes on a gruesome killing spree to find and consume human hearts in Santiago. Thinking that their father was responsible, and anxious to receive their inheritance, the Pinochet children hire a nun, Carmen, to exorcise and kill Augusto under the guise of auditing the family's wealth, and go to the farm, followed by Carmen. Carmen charms Augusto with her fluency in French, while he discovers that Fyodor is having an affair with Lucia but tolerates it as he has grown tired of her. Carmen extensively interviews the household over their legal troubles and finances, assembling a dossier which she hides in her room.Carmen reveals her true identity as a nun to Augusto and tries to exorcise him, but is overwhelmed by his presence and ends up having sexual intercourse with him and allows him to transform her into a vampire. This prompts the arrival of Margaret Thatcher, who is revealed to Claude's mother, having abandoned him at an orphanage at birth after she was raped and bitten by a strigoi. Margaret, jealous of Carmen's claims to Augusto's love, orders her son to kill her. Instead Augusto shows off his wealth to Carmen, whereupon Carmen reveals that she has been feigning her attraction to him and that her becoming a vampire was part of her mission on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church to infiltrate the Pinochets and gather information on their corrupt dealings. As she flees, she is captured and guillotined by Fyodor, who burns her dossier.Fyodor, Lucia and the Pinochet children then attempt to kill Augusto and Margaret to gain their inheritance, but Augusto kills Lucia by driving a stake through her heart and beheads Fyodor with a saw. As Augusto and Margaret rejuvenate themselves with vampire hearts and leave to start a new life, the children are left to salvage what they could of the farm. As they leave, Carmen's fellow nuns arrive at the property.</p>

                            <p>Description: In Mexico City, Sebastián Silva is a depressed, ketamine-addicted artist and filmmaker contemplating suicide by taking pentobarbital. His landlord and friend, Mateo, who is renovating Sebastián's apartment building, jokingly encourages his suicidal ideations. Sebastián's long-suffering housekeeper, Verónica "Vero", is concerned about him and worries that the abusive Mateo might fire her, but Sebastián barely acknowledges her.Sebastián travels to a gay nude beach, where he meets American comedian and social media influencer Jordan Firstman after nearly drowning. A fan of Sebastián's work, Jordan is convinced that their chance meeting is a sign that the two should work together on Jordan's television project. Jordan invites Sebastián to a party that night, where Jordan films Sebastián snorting ketamine and posts the video on his social media without Sebastián's permission. When Jordan refuses to delete the video, Sebastián angrily admonishes Jordan for his vapidity and uninspired ideas.Upon returning home, Sebastián has an online meeting with HBO executives, who reject his pitch. He mentions Jordan's project, which piques the executives' interest. He then contacts Jordan and agrees to work together; Jordan insists on moving in with him during their collaboration.Sebastián asks Vero to help him move a heavy couch from his rooftop storage space for Jordan to use. As they lift the couch, Sebastián becomes distracted by Jordan's incessant phone calls and accidentally falls from the rooftop to his death. Distraught, Vero covers his body and leaves for her niece's quinceañera in a daze, where she confesses the incident to her brother, Lalo. Lalo insists that the police will never believe her, so the two wrap the body in a tarp and hide it in the storage space.The next day, Jordan arrives at Sebastián's place, but is confused by Sebastián's absence. Thinking Sebastián has ghosted him, Jordan claims on social media that he and Sebastián fell in love and that Sebastián was excited for his project and invited him to stay. However, after finding Sebastián's phone and wallet inside the apartment one night, Jordan grows concerned and urges his followers to help him locate Sebastián.Upon finding Sebastián's journals, which detail his suicidal thoughts and interest in pentobarbital, Mateo becomes fearful that he may be partially responsible for Sebastián's possible suicide. Knowing that he left several incriminating voice messages on Sebastián's phone joking about the pentobarbital, Mateo expresses his concerns to his wife. Overhearing their conversation, Vero obtains pentobarbital and plants the empty box in Sebastián's trash can.Mateo sneaks into the apartment and threatens Vero for eavesdropping on him. He steals Sebastián's phone and journals, which Vero witnesses. Later, overwhelmed by stress and guilt, Vero breaks down in tears in front of Jordan, who comforts her, though the two cannot understand one another.Sebastián's brother, Juan, sees Jordan's posts and arrives in Mexico to help figure out what happened to him. The next day, the police arrive to investigate and find Sebastián's ketamine and the pentobarbital box. Believing the suicide to be confirmed, the police then question Mateo about the drugs, saying that they will need to file a report. Mateo panics and confesses that he took the journals and phone, only increasing suspicion against him. Juan is distraught at his brother's seemingly confirmed death, and Jordan leaves at Mateo's insistence. Mateo fires Vero for complying with the police's drug search.In the park across the street, using a translation app on his phone, Jordan asks Vero if she witnessed Mateo steal Sebastián's journals and phone. Vero confesses the truth into the phone, expressing remorse for her part in Sebastián's accidental death and hoping his family can find peace. The app poorly translates her confession, leaving Jordan confused as Vero walks away with the bottle of pentobarbital in her hand.</p>

                            <p>Description: Patrice, an art dealer, was in the midst of a tough period. With no art sales in sight, the chance that her gallery could go out of business was looming ever closer. Desperate to settle her debt with her drug supplier Nate, Patrice offered up a painting in its place. This painting caught the attention of Nate's boss, Gordon, who operates a criminal underworld from a Jewish bakery. Gordon saw the potential there to use Patrice's gallery as a money laundering device since the value of art is highly subjective. Patrice, while clearly uncomfortable with the plan, reluctantly agreed. For the money laundering ruse to work properly, Gordon knew they would need more artwork. To achieve this, he enlisted the help of Reggie, a professional assassin who goes by the alias "The Bagman". What began as a desperate try to save her gallery quickly spiraled out of control. The artwork that Reggie produced brought a strange turn of events and caused quite a stir in the art world. Even though she was feeling the pressure from all sides, Patrice did her best to manage the situation.—Nick Maston</p>

                            <p>Description: Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan became fast friends during their youth in Germany. With Rob coming from a broken home and Fab having left an abusive household, they shared a similar upbringing, as well as a future goal: to become famous superstars. In a few short years, their dreams came true. Their first album, "Girl You Know It's True", went platinum six times in 1989 and sold over 30 million singles worldwide. Rob and Fab, better known as Milli Vanilli, became the most popular pop duo in the late 1980s. However, their ascension to success came with a devastating price that ultimately brought their undoing. Featuring exclusive interviews with Rob and Fab, plus the real singers, record executives, and producer mastermind behind the con, this documentary pulls back the curtain on the story that we thought we knew, but didn't, and delivers a compelling look at the price of fame and the opportunistic commodification of artists.—Keep On Running Pictures</p>

                            <p>Description: Anvitha Ravali Shetty is a 38 year old single independent woman working as a master chef in the United Kingdom living with her single mother. Her mother has very less time left to live as she suffers from an unknown illness so she keeps convincing her daughter to get married soon. Anvitha who is very adamant, doesn't believe in marriage and love due to her parents' failed marriage and hence chooses to be single for the rest of her life. Later, her mother requests her to take her back to India as she wants to spend her last days there. Eventually after a few months her mother dies and Anvitha starts feeling lonely. As she doesn't believe in marriage, she tries to become a mother through IUI, as she feels she too needs a person during her last days. She feels that, like her mother, she doesn't need any man to love her throughout her life and instead, her own biological child can be her supporter throughout her life just like she had her mother.With the help of her friend Kavya, they visit a fertilization center to get pregnant. Anvitha learns the norms and comes to know that random males are taken as donors, which concerns her. She tries to choose her sperm donor through interviewing other men. Anvitha as clear as she is, writes down all the qualities she needs in her donor. Finally, she meets Siddhu Polishetty who is a 33 year old guy doing stand up comedy in one restaurant. She is impressed with him at first sight and tries to talk to him about her intention, but Kavya stops her stating it might make him awkward, so she requests her to take it slow and know more about his habits and personality first. Anvitha gets convinced and gives her visiting card to him to meet her. After a few meetings both get along pretty quick and gradually Siddhu catches feelings for Anvitha, not knowing her actual intention. One day, Siddhu tries to propose her but it backfires when Anvitha reveals the real reason why she wanted him. The concept of getting pregnant without getting married stuns Siddhu and he gets disturbed. Siddhu and his friend, Rahul go to a coffee shop where he unexpectedly sees Anvitha taking to another guy. This enrages him and he intervenes between them and causes a scene. Siddhu, who is now unable to let Anvitha go and unable to accept the fact that Anvitha is going to be with another man if he doesn't help her, later decides to help Anvitha. He goes to her house and begs for forgiveness and asks her to consider him. Siddhu mistakenly believes that Anvita will conceive by the old fashioned method of intercourse, as he doesn't know the general procedure for sperm donation. Later, Siddhu is shocked to know when Anvitha tells him that it is not the usual process of intercourse and instead it is IUI which they have to follow. He is shocked but agrees to the procedure stating that he wants everything she has to be from him. He undergoes vigorous diet and exercise which is monitored by her and the doctor.Siddhu gets frustrated in the process and gets drunk. This enrages Anvitha and begs him to not to do the work if he is uninterested and confesses that she doesn't have feelings. She also tells him that she doesn't believe in love and marriage because of her parents's divorce which happened when she was 6. Siddhu realizes his mistake and resumes his dieting. One day the procedure date is fixed and according to the contract the donor should not involve into her personal life and shouldn't contact her after the procedure otherwise legal action shall be taken. This breaks Siddhu even more and he bids farewell to Anvitha asking her a favor. He further requests Anvita to tell her daughter or son that their father was a person who genuinely loved her instead of just some random sperm donor when they inevitably ask who their father was. Later Anvitha gets her results positive in her pregnancy test and goes to share the news with Siddhu but Rahul stops her by saying even she shouldn't interfere in his life as and when she wants as he is just healing from their separation since Siddhu too can't, according to the contract and asks her to leave him.Anvitha, heartbroken leaves India. While she returns to UK, she is disturbed due to Siddhu's absence and decides she needs a change of place. She moves to country side somewhere in UK and starts spending time there. Meanwhile, Siddhu successfully gives frequent stand ups and gains popularity. His father gets to know about his feelings and asks him to give assurance to Anvitha that he is beside her through thick and thin as she is scared of getting left out in a relationship.Siddhu travels every corner of UK to get to know about her. But, in the end finally meets her at the hospital at the time of her delivery and tries to talk to her, he is stopped by the staff stating only her partner can enter the labor room. Anvitha recognizes his voice and replies he is the father of the child and this moves Siddhu. He sees his name in the medical form as the father. Finally blessed with a baby the movies ends with Siddhu doing a stand up where he reveals he is married to Anvitha and leaves the stage saying he needs to change his daughter's diaper.</p>

                            <p>Description: The winner of two Piolet d'Or awards, Ueli Steck, became popular for climbing the North Face of the Eiger at a record speed of 3 hours and 54 minutes in 2007, and he eventually broke his record the next year by climbing it in 2 hours, 47 minutes, and 33 seconds. Ueli is Swiss. Ueli was more interested in the sports aspect of climbing and not the adventure aspect of it.
Ueli wanted to climb the trilogy of Alpine North Faces in record time.This marked the beginning of Steck's speed-climbing career. He immediately became a media sensation and was considered one of the best Alpinists of all time. Ueli gave birth to modern-style Alpinism, which essentially involved risking his life for the climb. He did not use ropes and solely depended on the grip of his hands and shoes to climb the mountains. Even when the routes were difficult, Ueli always chose to stick to his extreme style of climbing solo and without a harness.Fellow mountain climbers discuss how Ueli Steck was all about discipline and motivation. He is remembered for being extremely hardworking, and he meticulously planned every climb of his. Ueli admitted that he was not a natural athlete, and therefore, to achieve his goals, he had to work extra hard. He trained rigorously, and once he started to climb, he never turned back. For Ueli, mountain climbing was not an adventure he enjoyed; instead, he treated the entire ordeal as a sport where timing and goal were absolutely crucial.
Ueli brings the modern style to Alpinism.The high that he experienced in 2008 made him crave success all the more. He needed to prove himself over and over again, which meant he had to climb more and more mountains.Ueli enjoyed the media attention he received, and he never said no to sponsorship. He paved the path to making a living through mountain climbing, and he was particularly successful in doing so because he had the capability of appealing to a larger crowd. Even though the general audience might not get all of the mountain climbing jargon, they were familiar with speed, time, and the entire sports aspect of it. Ueli eventually managed to climb the remaining two famous north faces of Matterhorn and Grandes Jorasses at record speed as well. By bringing in time, Ueli Steck had unknowingly called for competition. Once a record is set, it is natural for someone else to try to break it. To stay relevant, he had to continue climbing and setting more records, and while he enjoyed every bit of speed climbing, maybe certain things are not meant for competitions, especially if they are life-threatening.Dani Arnold trained to become a mountain guide during his free time. He took an interest in climbing from a young age, and Ueli Steck was an inspiration for him. Steck made him believe that it was possible to earn a living through mountaineering. Dani Arnold followed Steck closely to understand his style, and once he felt confident in himself, he decided to climb the north face of Eiger. Dani knew he was taking on a herculean challenge, but he believed he was ready for it. Climbs that took hours, he could complete in a short span.Dani stated that once he started to climb Eiger, he felt comfortable and did not face trouble increasing his speed. Dani Arnold ended up breaking Ueli Steck's record and setting a new one-two hours and twenty-eight minutes. Dani Arnold kept a low profile, and it was almost unexpected for him to break Steck's record.
Soon after reaching the summit, Arnold texted Steck because he believed he deserved to be the first one to know about it. But Ueli Steck did not take the competition well.
Ueli was the complete opposite of Dani. Ueli trained hard and was very methodical. Dani was very unorganized but was naturally gifted.The rivalry began when Dani came across a newspaper interview where Ueli belittled his achievement by pointing out that Dani had used a rope during the climb. He went so far as to accuse Dani of cheating, and it showed how insecure he felt at the time. According to Ueli, he was the one who created the idea of a pure climb, and he tried to use it as a differentiating factor between him and his competitor. Dani felt the need to prove himself after the media started to question his achievements as well. He did wish to be taken lightly, and it became important for him to prove to the world that he was worth watching out for.After the Swiss Alps, Ueli Steck shifted his focus to the Himalayas. He was searching for something more challenging, and the south face of Annapurna was perfect for his project since it was extremely dangerous. Even though the climb was severely demanding, Ueli was impossible to stop. Annapurna had a 1:3 death to Summit rate. The rockfalls and the avalanches on the mountain were constant and deadly.
It was assumed that Ueli would stop climbing after strong winds started to blow, creating avalanches all across the face, but the next morning, when his team saw Ueli return to the base, it became obvious to them that he did not stop and made it to the summit. Ueli's Annapurna climb became a point of debate since he did not have a single picture taken on the summit. People demanded proof, but there was none. Ueli admitted that he should have carried proof, but then again, several more important things were going through his mind, and safely making it back to the base was the dominating one. While many believe he indeed made it to the top, some argue that it might be untrue. People were left wondering if the media was responsible for pushing Ueli Steck to the point where he had to lie to prove himself.Meanwhile, the media got to Dani Arnold as well after his achievement was repeatedly questioned. To prove himself, he climbed the north face of Matterhorn, and once again, he broke Ueli's record of 1 hours and 56 minutes, by 10 minutes.
Ueli Steck did not comment on his achievement, but the rivalry became obvious to the world when Steck announced that he would speed-climb the North Face of Eiger again. He won back the title of the fastest climb on the North Face of the Eiger by six minutes. The rivalry had turned bitter and petty by then. A competition that could result in death must technically not be celebrated, but that was exactly what was going on. It was either winning or dying at that point. Dani's parents believe that social media plays a huge role in affecting mountaineers. The need for validation has reached an extreme level.Ueli admitted that, as a thirty-eight-year-old, it was not easy for him to accept that he was past his best achievements. He needed to challenge himself over and over again. Ueli Steck died during the Nuptse climb in the Himalayas. He slipped and succumbed to a thousand-meter fall. His body was buried in Kathmandu, Nepal, and a memorial service was held in Switzerland. Ueli Steck was aware of how fatal his style was, and people close to him believed that he was having the time of his life during his last climb. Ueli believed in grand living instead of always playing it safe. Dani Arnold continues to speed climb all across the globe, and Ueli's death shows him how things could end for him. He hopes that he will be able to stop himself at the right time if the circumstances ever turn unfavorable. Dani went on to break Ueli's record once again. He had climbed the north face of Grandes Jorasses in the recorded time of approximately 2 hours and 4 minutes, beating Ueli's record by 17 minutes.The trend of making records in mountain climbing could result in many more deaths. The need for validation and media attention plays a huge role, but then again, it has gone too far to be stopped now. There will be others aiming to break the records that have been set. It all comes down to whether one wants to take in the pure joy of climbing a mountain or even the sport aspect of it or would risk their life primarily for fame and money. Dani admits that it is just a sport, and as difficult as it was for him to accept, it is obvious that someday someone will break his records, and that is the nature of the sport.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lily, an asthmatic mid 20s Muslim doctor and her fiancée Kit go on one last holiday with their med school friends before they move abroad. Lily also meets Kit's over-protective younger sister, Rachel, which goes okay, but Rachael is suspicious of Lily's motivation. She has never given her brother's girlfriends a chance, Lily is no different. They pick up a hitchhiker, Marc, on the way to Saint Joseph's guesthouse. Using the legend of the hanged girl, they set up a prank to make Lily think she's the next victim of an evil cult. Terrified at first, once she works out it's a joke, she seems okay with it. But she is not and starts having vivid nightmares and flashbacks about the hanged girl, so real that she starts to wonder if they are real. Lily hides this and the holiday seems to be going well, except Rachel gets more and more vindictive. Lily fights back, and this triggers Rachel to attack harder. As day becomes night, things start to get weird, as the friends struggle to control their emotions, something is not right. Lily's research says it may be supernatural, the ghost of the hanged girl. Lily tries to persuade them that they must escape, but it's too late. As their fears and desires start to control their actions, they turn on each other as death stalks them. In a final twist, nothing is what it seems.—JD</p>

                            <p>Description: Mike Veeck grew up in the shadow of his hustler father, Hall of Fame baseball owner Bill Veeck. The Veeck name became both legendary and notorious in professional baseball as they introduced the fun at ballparks giveaways, theme nights, fireworks, and more. But it all came to a screeching halt when Mike blew up his father's career. Exiled from the game he loved, the younger Veeck spent the next few decades clawing his way up from rock bottom, determined to redeem himself. After receiving distressing news, what started as a journey to reclaim the family legacy, became an opportunity to appreciate that family more fully.</p>

                            <p>Description: Norman is an average teenage boy that's into aliens and has an above average concern for the future of our planet. It all becomes very real when three microscopic, peace-keeping aliens (Sophie, Max and Gus) crash land into his iced tea. They enlist him and his friends to save the planet from the intergalactic villain, Zolthard (also quite small) who has in turn taken control of their principal, Ms Witherington as well as two other teachers. Zolthard will stop at nothing to get his fleet of droids to invade Earth and dominate the giants that roam it. The story takes place in real time and after a short introduction to our characters, all the action is set in and around the school in a single narrative.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1956, Father Noiret and Jacques perform their daily chores at a church in Tarascon, France. While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death, all the while Jacques watches as he holds onto the priest's rosary.Following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has made friends with a young Irish girl named Sophie, as well as a teacher and her mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him, and the next day, she is asked by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe. While Irene travels to Tarascon, Sister Debra, a young novice, joins her without permission. During the train ride, Debra expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, while Irene explains to her the importance of faith.At Tarascon, Irene has a vision where she follows Jacques into an alley but ends up getting choked by Valak, the demon who takes the form of a nun. The next morning, Debra tells Irene that she had met with Jacques and he had given her Father Noiret's rosary. At the same time, in the boarding school, Sophie is bullied by her classmates and locked up in the abandoned chapel of the school where no-one is allowed to enter. The bullies tell her to look at a window with a goat on the mosaic, and claim that if she looks away, the devil will appear to haunt her. The sun shines through the mosaic and makes the eye of the goat shine red.Irene and Debra travel to Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian who tells them that the demon they are investigating was an angel rejected by God and that the emblem on the rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire by the pagan, she miraculously did not die; St. Lucy's family rescued her eyes and dispersed throughout the world. The librarian suggests that the demon is killing the descendants of St. Lucy because it wants this relic, the eyes, which were last known to be stored in a former monastery, which is revealed to be a boarding school in the present day.Irene and Debra go to the school to find Maurice in distress with Sophie and Kate. Irene tells Maurice that the demon is inside of him, and is devastated by the revelation, but is then taken over by the demon and attacks Irene and Debra, before being knocked unconscious. Inside the chapel of the school, Sophie shows Irene, Debra, and Kate the game her classmates made her play and Debra uses a flashlight to make the eyes of the goat on the mosaic glow red. The red light points in the direction of where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried and Irene finds the relic.Debra and Kate are separated from Irene and Sophie to protect the schoolgirls from a demon goat. Under the influence of the demon, Maurice escapes and attacks Irene, while Sophie grabs the relic and runs away. Maurice chases after Sophie and causes the bell tower building to collapse. Irene finds Sophie inside, and Debra reunites with the pair. Debra admits that she has seen a miracle and has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice until he manages to hold it himself. He lifts Irene in the air and sets her on fire, but she does not burn as she realizes that she is a descendant of St. Lucy and is able to harness the same power associated with the relic.Irene and Debra begin to pray the Words of Institution used in Christian celebrations of the Eucharist and barrels of wine present at the former monastery become the blood of Christ. As the blood of Christ soaks Valak, the demon perishes and is damned back to hell.</p>

When Robert is found dead at a hotel, his wife, Mia, (Sydney Cole Alexander), is devastated, especially when she uncovers that he was having an affair. As Mia leaves Robert's office following his death, she recognizes Sonja's perfume when they pass by each other. After learning that Robert has died, Sonja takes it as a sign to give her marriage another chance. Hoping to reconnect, Jason rents a remote cabin where a woman named Clare introduces herself as their neighbor. Slowly reconnecting, Sonja leaves Jason alone in the cabin to head back into the city for a work emergency. While Sonja is away, a thunderstorm hits the cabin, and Clare shows up on Jason's doorstep claiming her power is out. Jason invites Clare inside for shelter, but when she kisses him, he remains faithful to Sonja. When Sonja returns to the cabin, she is immediately suspicious of Clare. Determined to uncover what Clare is really up to, Sonja sneaks into her home where she is caught by Clare, who reveals her true identity as Mia. Realizing how far Mia is willing to go for revenge, Sonja must stop Mia before she loses everything she cares about.—Jakkepoes</p>

But as Sky and Cam slowly uncover hidden cameras and secrets of the duplex's previous owner, obsession consumes their marriage and they both fall into destructive forms of voyeurism. When new tenants move in downstairs, their fixation with observing others has deadly consequences and they are forced to confront the very things they have been consumed by.</p>

                            <p>Description: Jack Kelly (Bill Burr), Connor Brody (Bobby Cannavale), and Mike Richards (Bokeem Woodbine) are best friends, business partners, and old dads. After agreeing to sell their throwback sports apparel company, they're excited to punch their tickets to the lives they've always dreamed of. But when the company is made over by an eccentric new millennial CEO (Miles Robbins), Jack's anger boils over, creating a series of crises at work, home, and his son's ultra-progressive preschool. In the aftermath, Jack and his fellow old dads must fight to win back their families and self-respect on an unlikely quest that takes them from Palm Desert casinos to strip clubs to the e-scooter-riddled streets of Los Angeles.—Netflix</p>

                            <p>Description: In the approach to Christmas, Ashley Durreau and Scott Briggs have both just arrived in Idaho Falls, in some respects the last place they want to be, in addition to each having unexpectedly just broken up with the person with who they were to spend Christmas. A local girl, Ashley is a commercial real estate broker in New York City, and with the exception of spending time with her loving family, her parents who sacrificed much in their own lives to get her on her feet in the big city, Ashley has tried to put Idaho Falls behind her due partly to the sacrifice by her parents. With a recent work setback, she would rather be back in New York City to get her career back on track. Scott has just been traded to play for the local junior hockey team, the Idaho Falls Fighting Trout. The son of who is expected to be inducted into the NHL Hall of Fame this year, Scott has dreams of making it into the NHL himself to measure up to his father, but at age thirty-two, a good decade or more older than all his teammates, his time is running out, especially as he has to be called up to the team in Boise before the NHL is even a possibility. Scott ends up living in the Durreaus' guest house while in town, and while Scott would just like to spend as much time on the ice in his goal of getting out of Idaho Falls as quickly as possible, Coach Jensen stresses to him that to do so, he has to be a good team player which means participating in community activities as part of the team in the hockey mad town, especially important at Christmas. As Ashley and Scott spend time together as they work on those stated goals, they may each come to realizations that those goals may not be what they really want but are solely expectations they have placed on themselves as they start to fall for each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: The Quantum Devil is a fitting title for what we get to watch here, as four exceptional graduates of quantum science are invited by a controversial host, to earn a record pay of $ 500000,- each, for helping him successfully finish an experiment to travel into another dimension. Arrival at the mansion of their host already makes them realize something is odd, may be afoot. Then, their host is called away, leaving the four guests legitimated to start the experiment without him. The call being a ruse, as the host, Cervovich Senior, actually decides to use a different machine, allowing him to supervise the four candidates without them being aware of it. The team successfully creates a quantum drift, but weird coincidences make that seem a flawed success, as some sense of menace remains persistently. Finally, the team realizes that they are in trouble, as one by one they get murdered, until only one candidate still is left alive. Deluded, that he can ignore the diabolical aka homicidal antagonists and just flee back to 'reality', he is blocked from that option by the host proving to have quite some power to alter that quantum pocket dimension they are stuck in. In a final showdown, the host wins by cheating, returning to the real world to supervise similar experiments that did not go that well. The former four candidates are left behind, as if ghosts (trapped in that quantum dimension).—Andre Michael Pietroschek</p>

                            <p>Description: Thirty-nine-year-old Camil embarks on a dreamlike trip where the banal and the surreal merge. Struggling to come to terms with losing control - of his work, his social status, his relationship - he sets off on a search that leads him to question the basis of his identity as a man. He pursues his girlfriend into an increasingly bizarre and disturbing world of community and ritual before being confronted by a tragi-comic role-reversal that leads us to question everything.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lidia and Manuel are trying to live their professional lives and to keep the romance alive. But Francisco, Manuel's father, moved in with them. Lidia is doing very good at her job. So much that she gets a promotion which means moving to Monterrey, away from both families. On the other hand, Manuel's beer business is not moving forward and is close to failure. A sudden death reunites the García and San Román's families and they are forced to think about their future. Especially Rosa, who deals with her husband's memory while trying to find a place for Jaime in her house and life. Both families welcome their death in their day and prepare for a life that will never be the same.—Andrea Bernal</p>

                            <p>Description: Only the few members of Yellow Door have seen fellow member Bong Joon-ho's directorial debut film Looking for Paradise, which was never released. This stop-motion animation about a gorilla leaving a dark and dirty basement to escape the attacks of dung bugs and heading to paradise was screened at an end-of-the-year party for Yellow Door members. When the wooden box containing the 8mm film hidden deep in Bong's study for thirty years is opened, cinephiles' memories of the early 1990s will come flooding back as well. In the era of film enthusiasts, when everyone was mad about studying film, Yellow Door was their own cinematheque and film school, and above all, an ideal youth community.</p>

Behind the Veil is a heart-wrenching story about love, marriage, betrayal, addiction, and suffering. Stacey is a successful woman trapped by the image of success. Darrel is a strong man battling his own demons in private. They are models of hope in their community but carrying pain in their heart. Together they teach us that marriage won't heal what you refuse to reveal, and love won't fix what lust broke.—Mya Speller Cullins</p>

In 1960, teenager Edgar Williams was killed in a freight elevator accident while at work... at least that's what everyone was led to believe. But if that's true, why has someone been secretly placing flowers on his grave for all these years? Could it be his death was a cover up? If so, why? Who can be trusted? As Chris sets out to solve the mystery that has affected his relationship with his mother since childhood, he risks his life to uncover the truth and deliver justice for his uncle, once and for all.—Brad Podowski</p>

                            <p>Description: Marine biologist Dr. Juniper Jones, a self-admitted introvert, has never stayed in one place for long, preferring to see the world, thus needing to make the most of her time in each locale. In the approach to Christmas, she, currently in Amsterdam, plans to head to Scandinavia for the holidays to see the northern lights, before heading on to her next assignment in South Africa. However, she answers the call of her best friend, Candice Adams of the Mystic Aquarium in Mystic, Connecticut, to work at the aquarium, in the current absence of a head marine biologist, solely to oversee the imminent release of what was an injured harbor seal before she heads off to South Africa on December 26th. Going to Mystic is despite learning that Candice's brother, Sawyer Adams, still lives there. Only having met once ten years ago at Candice's wedding, Juniper and Sawyer had a memorable couple of days until miscommunication led to them breaking contact with each other. While Juniper and Sawyer still think about the other, they blame the other for the way things ended between the two of them. Unlike Juniper, Sawyer, who owns his own pizza parlor, talks often about seeing the world, but his knowledge of the world is largely limited to Google as he feels it is never a good time to leave Mystic. Juniper and Sawyer's reunion is a cordial but cautious one in each not liking confrontation. The question then becomes if the two can overcome their differences to make a relationship work, those differences which still do include what happened between them ten years ago for them to break contact.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are catering the Elk Park society wedding of the year, the bride, groom and many of their friends in the wedding party with who they went to school. The bride is Jessamyn, Tom's ex-wife, who Goldy is not surprised to find is the ultimate bridezilla. The groom is equally wealthy Sterling, whose family left town after high school. The maid of honor and best man are Katy, who used to date Sterling, and Ray who is Katy's current serious boyfriend. But not all is all right with this union in there being hard feelings between some on either side stemming from a business scam from years ago which some have never forgot or forgiven. On the morning after the rehearsal dinner, one key member of the wedding is found dead in the wedding venue hotel, and another has gone missing. While Tom starts to investigate, he is pulled from the case due to his association to Jessamyn, with Detective Dave Trach seconded to lead the investigation, Dave and Tom who have a history on many levels which has led to their animosity. Without even needing to ask the other, Tom and Goldy start investigating together, Goldy who has the benefit of knowing many of the players and their history. They nonetheless have to do their work without letting specifically Dave know what they're doing. It becomes more difficult for them, but especially Tom, when Dave places Tom on the top of his suspect list, part of that accusation based on their history.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1984, Oregon-based Nike, Inc. is on the verge of shutting their basketball shoe division due to low sales. In response to this, Marketing VP Rob Strasser (Jason Bateman), along with co-founder and CEO Phil Knight (Ben Affleck), task Nike's high school basketball talent scout Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) to come up with a new spokesperson for Nike basketball shoes.
The company made a loss and Knight just had to fire 25% of the employees. The basketball division has an entire budget of $250,000. Sonny wants more, which Knight refuses. Nike dominated the running shoe market and a billion dollar business, but Knight is skeptical if people really even care about basketball shoes.Sonny is a gambler and spends a lot of his time in Vegas. He wins most of the time, but then has a habit to blow it all on one bad bet.
In 1984, Converse has a 54% share of the basketball shoe market, and Adidas has 29%. Nike is at 17% share. Nike offers more money for endorsements, yet high school basketball players, going to regional, want to sign for Adidas as they are considered "hot". Nike is considered a jogging company. Converse is the NBA all star shoe.
Howard White (Chris Tucker) tells Sonny that he always signed player through their mothers. As boys listen to their mothers.
The Nike slogan "Just do it" apparently came from the last words of a convict who was facing a firing squad.While considering the basketball players chosen in the 1984 NBA draft, Nike's executives think third pick Michael Jordan (Damian Young) is off limits, being both a fan of Adidas and too expensive for the basketball division's meager budget. Nike is considering going after 3 players between the 5th and the 20th picks.
Sonny speaks to a grocery clerk who says that Jordan is over-rated and his success in high school is not likely to be converted in NBA. He got high in the draft pick due to the one shot which helped his team win the Championship at college level.
However, once Sonny watches Jordan's highlights in conjunction with an Arthur Ashe commercial for his Head rackets, Vaccaro becomes convinced that Nike should pursue who he considers a generational talent, with both brand and athlete building off each other.Sonny argues to Strasser that Jordan was just 18 years old, yet the whole final play was designed around him. Even his coach saw greatness in him. Sonny wants the entire budget to sign Jordan. Nike to build a shoe around Jordan.
David Falk is Jordan's agent and says that Jordan is an Adidas fan. Adidas is making a $250,000+ offer. Nike doesn't stand a chance. David says Jordan likes Adidas's tracksuits, where Nike doesn't even hold a candle to them.
Sonny tells Knight that he will bet his career to get Jordan in. Knight will only sign off if Sonny has a meeting, but David refuses to get a meeting with Jordan until Sonny makes a written offer. Sonny can't make a written offer as he is not authorized yet.Following dinner with his friend George Raveling (Marlon Wayans), who coached Jordan in the Olympic tournament, and asking for his support in courting the star. George supports Sonny but is clear that if Sonny doesn't close with Jordan, bypassing David could mean that Sonny loses his job.
Vaccaro travels to Wilmington, North Carolina, where he convinces Michael's mother Deloris (Viola Davis) that Nike would give Jordan all the attention that he would not receive from his preferred brands Adidas and Converse. Sonny tells Deloris exactly how the Converse and Adidas meetings would go and begs her to consider Nike, if she believes what he is saying is right.After receiving a negative phone call from Jordan's agent David Falk (Chris Messina) regarding contacting his client's family, Vaccaro learns that the Jordans have scheduled a meeting at Nike's Beaverton, Oregon headquarters the following Monday.
Vaccaro and Strasser start preparing their pitch while requesting shoe designer Peter Moore (Matthew Maher) to prepare a prototype, which Moore names "Air Jordan" after Nike's Air Sole technology. Those days NBA had a rule that a basketball shoe had to be 51% white. Sonny and Strasser decide to go beyond the 49% color and just pay the fine of $5000 per game to the NBE, for breaking that rule.
In the meantime, Knight agrees to assign the basketball division's entire $250,000 budget to hire Jordan.After the meeting with Jordan and his parents is successful, Vaccaro learns that Adidas matched the offer while adding a Mercedes Benz 380SL, and he thinks the deal will not go through. However, Vaccaro receives a call from Deloris, who states that Michael will sign with Nike on the condition he earns a percentage of every Air Jordan sold.Even though Vaccaro thinks the company's higher-ups would not accept this bonus, Knight is told he deems it necessary to ensure the endorsement.
An epilogue reveals the Air Jordan exceeded Knight's expectations of $3 million in sales, earning $162 million in its first year and becoming a steady source of income for Nike. Today Air Jordan does $4 Billion in annual sales for Nike.
Strasser got the credit. Howard White became the founding father of the Air Jordan division at Nike. Michael ears $400 Million a year from Nike due to his revenue share. Nike bought Converse in 2003. David Falk sold his company for $100 million. Sonny was counted as one of the greatest sports reformers in history.
Deloris runs charities. Her Air Jordan deal meant that billions more went to athletes and their families.</p>

                            <p>Description: SP Diana Joseph (Tabu) captures members of the Sikka Gang and confiscates a haul of cocaine worth Rs 1,000 Crores. An undercover officer Abbas Ali (Tarun Gahlot ) known as Raunak, has joined Ashwathama (Deepak Dobriyal) (known as Ashu) who is co-leader of the Sikka Gang. Raunak gives information about Ashu to Diana.Ashu seeks help from corrupt NCB officer Devraj Subramaniam (Gajraj Rao) who instructs another corrupt officer Deep Singh (Lokesh Mittal) to add Rohypnol to drinks made for police officers at the farewell party of IG Jayant Malik (Kiran Kumar). Devraj has agreed to help Ashu recover the cocaine in exchange for a share of Rs 50 Crores. Devraj tells Ashu that there is a traitor in his gang and tells him that Diana is the officer after the Sikka gang. Ashu swears vengeance.
Diana does not partake but everyone else falls unconscious. Diana knows that the Sikka gang will want to recover the drugs. Diana has stored the drugs at Laalganj police station. She doesn't know that she has Ashu's brother Nithari in her custody as nobody has ever seen him. Laalganj is a British era jail made of solid stone and has a bunker in the basement.A prisoner named Bholaa (Ajay Devgn) has been released from prison, but was arrested by an officer on his way to the town for his arrogance. The officer had brought Bholaa to the party, with him handcuffed in the back of his jeep. After the entire force passed out, Bholaa was the only one Diana could turn to for help.
Joseph tries to convince him to drive a truck taking the sedated officers to the hospital then on to Laalganj police station. Although he is reluctant at first (he was on his way to meet his daughter after spending 10 years in jail), he agrees when Diana says that he is condemning many other daughters by abandoning their fathers.Meanwhile, Ashu hires a bounty hunter on Joseph and the rest of her police force. As Joseph, Bholaa and sidekick Kadchi (Amir Khan) drive they are attacked by various gangs.
The mole Deep Singh, who has hidden with the sedated officers, provides them with the location updates. Bholaa reveals his fighting powers and kills all the goons. Ashu also sends his gang to attack the police station and to free his brother Nithari (Vineet Kumar), who was caught with the cocaine. A new inspector, Angad Yadav (Sanjay Mishra), who was recently transferred to Laalganj, gets assigned by Joseph to defend the police station.
Bholaa cannot understand why he is involved in this fight, but Diana continues to remind him his civic and national duty. She promises to unite him with his daughter. Bholaa wants a room for his daughter and an admission in a good school.When Ashu arrives with his gang, they try to breach the police station which is barricaded by Yadav and some students who happened to be at the station at that time. Joseph is nearly tricked into ordering the release of the prisoners (she offers a deal to release the prisoners in exchange for Ashu not killing anyone in the station), but she realizes that it was a trap set by Nithari who was in the lock up. Nithari planned to kill everybody after being released.Ashu manages to get inside but Yadav and the students manage to arrest him. The student Chetan (Chetan Sharma) gets strangled to death by Ashu's gang with a lasso through a window and Yadav, fuming with rage, kills Ashu.
Joseph contacts medics to provide an emergency ambulance at a temple of Lord Shiva. As they wait, Bholaa narrates his past to Kadchi: he was a notorious gangster in Uttar Pradesh and fell in love with a doctor named Swara (Amala Paul), who reciprocated his love after he saved her from being sexually assaulted.Before their marriage, Bholaa gave up his gangster life, but Swara was killed by a ruthless gang leader known as Chomu (Abhishek Bachchan). Before dying, Swara gave birth to their daughter, Jyoti (Hirva Trivedi) but Bholaa got separated from her after receiving a long-term prison sentence.
Joseph shares her story about how she lost her unborn child when she was pregnant. An ambulance finally arrives and takes the sedated officers to hospital, then Ashu's big henchman Bhoora (Arpit Ranka) also turns up.
Before Bholaa is able to fight, Deep Singh stabs him, and he is brutally injured. While Joseph and Kadchi are taken away, Abbas is killed when he is discovered as the mole. Bholaa later regains consciousness and kills the whole gang all by himself, including Deep Singh, using the Trident of Lord Shiva. After this he chases after Bhoora, killing him and rescuing Joseph.After driving all night, Bholaa, Kadchi and Diana arrive in Laalganj police station using a secret passage and help the students along with Yadav to escape safely. Joseph burns the cocaine and after Ashu's reinforced gang finally breaches station, Bholaa destroys them all using a M134 Minigun.Shortly after, Nithari dies of shock after learning about Bholaa, and Devraj Subramaniam shoots himself after knowing that Bholaa was behind everything. Bholaa is reunited with his daughter Jyoti and they drive off happily in the truck with Kadchi and a puppy.
In a mid-credits scene, Chomu Singh learns about Bholaa's release and decides to destroy him.</p>

G4TV's flagship show launched the careers of hosts Olivia Munn and Kevin Pereira and was beloved by fans - a unique celebration of geek culture before it was cool. Diving into colossal cream pies, wearing funny fat suits and putting internet servers where the sun don't shine - anything could happen on an episode of Attack of the Show. It's been years since the original show went off the air in 2005 and one question remains: what really happened to G4TV and Attack of the Show?</p>

On the eve of the meeting, the envoy of the Kingdom of Jin died at the prime minister's residence, and the secret letter he was carrying disappeared. By chance, a small soldier and the deputy commander of the personal battalion were involved in this huge conspiracy. Prime Minister Qin Hui ordered the two to find the murderer within an hour, but things were far from that simple...

                            <p>Year: 2023</p>
                            <p>Language: en</p>
                            <p>Description: There is no definite answer as to why somebody like Anna shot to fame. No doubt she had a charming presence and an extremely beautiful face, but so did a lot of other women. Anna's destiny was already written, and the way her career progressed was almost magical. It didn't make sense how Marilyn Grabowski of Playboy magazine got to know about her or how she was introduced to Paul Marciano, owner of Guess.
The thing is, Anna's quest was in itself quite toxic, and the kind of desires she had made her incapable of feeling satisfied or happy. She was after money and stardom, and there was no problem with that, but she was ready to do anything and go to any extent to attain them. She made certain choices that wrecked her from within, and no matter what anybody said, the reason behind those choices made others question her principles.
Anna lacked meaningful partnerships in her life, not because she didn't have people, but because she always left those behind who were willing to sit down and listen to her and not just use her for their vested interests.Anna was born as Vicky Lynn and came from a humble background though her family always had enough resources for a decent lifestyle. But Anna wanted more. She was not happy living in Mexia, Texas, as she had big dreams and knew that staying in that city would get her nowhere. Anna started working at Jim's Krispy Fried Chicken, and soon, she got married to the chef of the outlet, Billy. Anna got a lot of attention from the male customers who used to come there, but Billy was probably the only one who didn't try to flirt or make any sort of pass at her. Billy's aloofness bothered Anna so much that she made it a point that he liked her, and once that happened, she decided to get married to him. She was 17 years old.
This was not merely a life event; it said a lot about Anna's psychology. Anna craved attention to the point that if she didn't get it, she started feeling restless and didn't hesitate to be reckless. Anna probably never loved Billy. Billy used to go to work, and Anna felt bored staying in her house. Billy was a jealous man, and he felt that if Anna worked, she would get a lot of male attention and might end up having an affair.After Anna had her first child, Daniel, she decided to leave Billy in search of greener pastures. Anna worked in a strip club, in Houston in 1986, where she met a colleague named Missy, who probably knew her better than a lot of other people who claimed to be a part of Anna's life. Anna earned a lot of money during this time, and she became the most sought-after performer in the club. She got a breast enlargement surgery and started taking pain medications.
In 1991, she met J. Howard Marshall, a geriatric Texan Billionaire, who bought her a car and a house and asked her to marry him. She refused as she wanted to make a name for herself.Anna got a photo-shoot done, and that became a turning point in her life as Marilyn Grabowski was on the lookout for new faces for Playboy magazine during that time, and the photographer asked her to take a look at Anna's photographs.
Anna won the playmate of the year title, and after that, there was no looking back. She started modeling for Guess (the biggest jean company of the time. Guess models were always the most famous, it was a big deal), and soon, she started getting offers for films. She changed her to Anna Nicole Smith in 1992.
Missy claimed to be her first female lover. Anna loved the spotlight, and the Paparazzi loved her. Her shots went for $2500 and up to $7500 per piece as she was always so animated.
Anna believed that she was the re-incarnated daughter of Marilyn Monroe. She still had an off and on relationship with Howard. Howard wanted to adopt Daniel so he could protect Anna and Daniel both. Anna' lawyer felt that their love was real, and Anna was not a gold digger.Anna also sought out her biological father Donald Eugene Hogan and met him after 24 years. She took him, her brother and Daniel to Disneyland. At this point, Anna was not too close to her mother. The brother, Donnie Hogan told Anna that their father was a child molester and had even admitted to forcing himself upon his own wife's sister. Anna stopped seeing Donald after he tried to have sex with her.
Anna falls into drug abuse and was even hospitalized for overdosing. The stress of her professional and personal life started to catch up with her.
Pierce Marshall is Howard's son and he had to put up with a lot of issues from Howard. He hated Anna even more to come so late in the game and try to take away everything after Pierce had to endure his father for decades.In every interview, Anna always said that she had had a traumatizing childhood. She used to say that her mother used to sexually and physically abuse her. Missy, her colleague from the strip club, noticed one time that she repeated Missy's story in one of her interviews and tried to gain sympathy from the people. Virgie, her mother, asked her why she was spreading lies, and Anna would always reply that a sad story always sold more and worked in the person's favor.Missy also confirmed that whenever they used to get into trouble, Anna's mother always came to the rescue, and she made sure that her daughter was safe. Even Anna's brother, Donald Hart, said that their mother never did anything of the sort, and Anna only propagated the lies to get sympathy from the people. Had Missy not noticed that what Anna was saying in the interview was, in fact, her life story, then maybe we would have believed Anna for a moment and entertained the fact that the mother and the brother were hiding the truth. This fabricated past life was also another means to get attention from the masses. Anna wanted to be in the spotlight at all times, and her desperation was taking her down a path of no return.Anna married J. Howard Marshall, and the age gap between the two was more than 60 years. Though Anna always maintained that she didn't do it for money, to any prudent man, her intentions were blatantly clear. Pierce worked behind the scenes so that Howard lost control over his own money. Howard could no longer spend lavishly on Anna. Howard was worth $1.6 billion and Anna claims that she was promised half of that.
Howard had already given Anna $14 million till his death, but Anna was left with nothing as she had spent everything away.After Marshall's death, Anna fought a case for his property with Marshall's son, E. Pierce Marshall. Anna lost the case and her husband, but she kept finding love in her life. Anna lost the case as she was revealed to be a lavish glutton during the trial.
Anna did a MTV show based on her own life. Anna loved Daniel with all her life. She also started gaining a lot of weight. Anna was distressed at what the media wrote about her. She stopped eating and drinking and became really sick.
Anna made a comeback representing a diet pills product called Trimspa. By that time Anna has managed to lose weight with diet and yoga.
She presents an award at the American Music Awards and flubs a line. She gets more speaking assignments.
She was on methadone for back pain relief. She had a breast implant that ruptured and had to be repaired. She was a mess behind the scenes. Methadone is a known prescription for heroin addicts.She was in a relationship with Larry Brikhead (a photographer) and then with her lawyer, Howard Stern. Anna wanted to have another child, and thus, in 2006, she gave birth to a girl named Dannielynn.
Both Larry and Howard claimed her daughter, and even Anna's bodyguard, Alexander Denk, claimed a similar thing, but eventually, it was proved in court that Brikhead was the father. Anna hated Larry as she knew that Larry wanted custody of their daughter.Anna was in the Bahamas at this time (Anna went there intentionally as in the Bahamas, whoever signs the Birth Certificate is the legal father), and Daniel, her son, had come to meet her there. Daniel, all of a sudden, died in the hospital room itself, where Anna was staying, and the reports said that he had died due to drug abuse. Approximately two weeks after the unfortunate incident, Anna and Howard Stern got married.Anna died on February 8th, 2007 (she was 39 years old), almost a year after giving birth to her daughter, and at the end of the documentary, we saw that it was concluded by the experts that there was no sign of foul play and the reason for her death was an accidental overdose of prescription medications. There were rumors in the media that Anna was murdered, but no concrete evidence was found, and it merely turned out to be a baseless conspiracy.
There was an official investigation to look into Daniel's death too, but like his mother, the authorities found out that consumption of a deadly combination of two antidepressants and methadone had led to the demise of the young boy who was 20 years old, and there was third-party involvement there.Anna idolized Marilyn Monroe, and she aspired to become like her one day. Maybe that is why Anna faked having a very difficult childhood, though everybody who knew her back in the day said that she was lying about it. Anna was solely responsible for whatever happened to her in her life. Whatever repercussions she had to bear and whatever hardships she had to go through were the result of her own actions.A lot of people said that she was hounded by the media when she gained weight, and there were all sorts of defamatory remarks made about her in public. Anna was the paparazzi's delight, and they absolutely loved recording her and taking pictures of her because they knew that she would do or say something that would get sensationalized and become the talk of the town.
No doubt Anna loved her son, but it is a fact that he felt neglected and lonely, and when he needed his mother the most, she was nowhere to be found.
Maybe he was stealing drugs from her stash, or maybe he was buying them from somewhere else, but the fact that he was using them on a regular basis and Anna was unaware of it was not something that should have ideally happened.
In the end, Anna's name was added to that long list of unfortunate and untimely deaths where the celebrities were unable to handle their stardom and lost themselves while desperately running after fame and money.</p>

                            <p>Description: In London, British-Pakistani teenager Ria Khan aspires to become a movie stunt-woman like her idol, Eunice Huthart. Under an alter-ego, "The Fury", Ria creates films of martial arts training with the help of her older sister Lena, who has dropped out of art school and moved back in with their loving but traditional parents, Fatima and Rafe, both of them discouraging Ria's dreams. At school, Ria is inseparable from her friends Clara and Alba, but their disapproving teacher urges her to pursue a more "serious" career. Ria's emails to Eunice about a potential mentor-ship go unanswered, and she is soundly defeated by the school bully Kovacs. The Khan family is invited to an Eid Mubarak soirée by Raheela, the leader of Fatima's social circle of Pakistani mothers, at her lavish mansion. Ria realizes the party has been arranged to find a suitable match for Raheela's son Salim, a successful geneticist, but is unable to stop Lena from agreeing to a date. To Ria's horror, Lena is charmed by Salim and, after a few whirlwind weeks of dating, agrees to marry him and move to Singapore. Despite their parents' support, Ria's refusal to accept Lena's choices, including abandoning her art career, drives the sisters apart. Convinced there must be a more sinister explanation, Ria enlists Clara and Alba's help to spy on Salim. They concoct an elaborate plan to steal his laptop, and Ria distracts him while her friends hack his computer, but they find nothing incriminating. Desperate to sabotage Lena's relationship, Ria lashes out at her friends, and breaks into Salim's bedroom to plant used condoms. She is caught, and confronts Salim with a picture of his first wife, whom he explains died in childbirth. Furious, Lena berates Ria to give up the fantasies that her sister will change her mind about marriage, or that she will ever become a stunt-woman. At odds with her sister and ignored by her friends, Ria gives up martial arts. She visits Raheela to apologize and is dragged into joining her spa day, where Raheela reveals her true colors and tortures Ria with waxing. Fighting off Raheela's staff, Ria stumbles into the mansion's secret lab and discovers that all the eligible women at the Eid party were secretly scanned and tested, and Lena was selected for her fertility. Escaping back home, Ria realizes she cannot convince her family of the truth. She tells Clara and Alba, and together they devise a plan, persuading Kovacs to drive them to the wedding to rescue Lena. Ria distracts the guests with a dance while Clara and Alba, disguised as waiters, sneak past the armed guard at Lena's door. They chloroform Lena and hide her inside a tea trolley, but Raheela captures Ria, and reveals she and Salim plan to impregnate Lena with a clone of Raheela. Forced to return Lena, the friends are locked in the bridal suite as the wedding begins, but Kovacs comes to their rescue and subdues the guard. Taking his gun, Ria holds Raheela at gunpoint and exposes her plan, leading Lena to remember being drugged and tested by Salim, who admits that his first wife died carrying his mother's clone. Raheela seizes the gun but is disarmed by Fatima, as Ria's family and friends fight off the guests. Lena subdues Salim while Ria finally masters a reverse spinning kick to defeat Raheela, and the police arrive as the sisters drive off. Reconciling with Lena, Ria finally receives an encouraging email from Eunice, and the sisters celebrate together.</p>

                            <p>Description: It is New Year's Eve in 2022, and the city of Baltimore is complete with people partying in their apartments or just going about their business. Amidst this chaos, as soon as a round of fireworks goes out, 17 people are shot dead with bullets flying out of nowhere at multiple locations. On the other side of the town, Eleanor Falco (Shailene Woodley), a police officer, is trying to settle a meager squabble at a diner involving an alcoholic homeless woman who refuses to leave the diner when she is paged to reach one of the sites of the shooting.Eleanor arrives at the site, and the police ascertain that all the bullets have been fired from a certain 17th floor apartment in the neighborhood. It is at the precise moment of this discovery the apartment blows up, sending a shock wave of panic among the other residents in the building. All the police personnel immediately rush to the site of destruction. Eleanor, along with one of her colleagues, stands outside the building recording videos of the fleeing residents. There was a possibility that the culprit was in the crowd.Soon, the police and the FBI reach the site and find no trace of the perpetrator. Eleanor, who had by this time climbed the stairs to the 17th floor without a gas mask while resting against one of the walls of the apartment due to ill health, manages to hint at investigating the toilet for any possible evidence of the shooter.Back at the police station, the chief FBI investigator, Geoffrey Lammark (Ben Mendelsohn), arrives and briefs the department about the task they have at hand - finding out the mass shooter - and explains the things they need to keep in mind while carrying on investigations. He particularly fancies Eleanor, who is prompt to tell him that the shooter is unlikely to strike again and why.We get an insight into the lonely life of Eleanor as she returns home that night. However, very early the next morning, she is summoned by Lammark. The latter insists that she assist him in this case because her thought process would be insightful, and she could also serve as the link between the Baltimore Police Department and the FBI in this investigation. Here, they meet Jack Mackenzie (Jovan Adepo), another FBI agent who would be following them closely in finding the shooter. What follows is a lot of brainstorming among the three as they try to understand the possible motive of the attack or the reason why it took place. We also understand that Lammark is under huge duress from the FBI authorities to successfully find the shooter.While Eleanor, Mammark and Mackenzie are still trying to figure out who the killer is, the investigators have narrowed it down to a teenage boy - who has confined himself to his room and watches ISIS videos - as their primary suspect. They proceed to zero down on him, despite Lammark's orders. Unfortunately, the boy jumps out of his bedroom window and dies in the process.As the authorities press upon Lammark to find the shooter, he invites Eleanor home and introduces her to his husband... revealing himself to be a closeted homosexual. Lammark also confronts Eleanor about her FBI rejection, citing psychiatric issues such as depression as the reason. She confesses that she took up a job in the police force to save her from her own self-destructive tendencies.A few days later, another horrific incident takes place. In a shopping mall, a man is seen stealing the clothes of a guy from the male changing room and washing it clean in the sink area of the toilet. Another man spots him in the act and informs the mall security guards about this unaccepted behavior, who try to trace the stranger down. When they finally find him, he is stealing food at the food court. As the guards tried to ask him to leave, the man pulls out a gun and shoots the people around him dead. He escapes from the rest of the police, who are after him, by blowing them up with grenades planted in a nearby dustbin. Lammark and Eleanor reach the place shortly afterward and are horrified by the nonchalance of the man.The news spreads like wildfire. The FBI takes down a group of local NRA members who support gun violence in another attempt at finding the perpetrator. In the course of the investigation, Lammark and Eleanor come to believe that the shooter has access to old guns and military equipment, and the lab stool result shows that the man was on a plant-based diet in the days following up to New Year's Eve. However, the authorities at this point have lost confidence in Lammark and his team after the second attempt at crackdown and both Lammark and Eleanore are removed from investigating the case any further.

A man named Dean Possey (Ralph Ineson).Throughout the whole movie, the detectives at work come to identify the primary traits of this man - a white guy, not a meat eater, and someone with access to old military weapons.

This led to his imprisonment for two years before he was released on parole in December 1999. Possey's father, Sergeant Arthur Possey, was the shooting instructor of the 75th Rangers, and Dean's parole had been supported by letters</p>

                            <p>Description: Princess Fu Yi (Julie Chen), the only daughter of the Chinese Emperor Han Xuandi (91-48 BC), escapes from a rogue prince, Deng Tsin Qin (Bun Hay Mean), and flees to Gaul, seeking help from Asterix (Guillaume Canet) and Obelix (Gilles Lellouche).It is 50 BC and Gaul is entirely occupied by Rome, except for one little fishing village. Roman Legionnaires have a tough time against this Gaulish village. 4 Roman camps surround the village and still unable to conquer it.
Asterix is worried about the long-term health impact of using the magic potion excessively. But he knows that the Gauls cannot fight the Romans without it.The village has Unhygienix (Jason Chicandier) the fish monger, Cacofonix (Philippe Katerine) the guy who cannot sing, Vitalstatistix (Jérôme Commandeur) the village chief, Getafix (Pierre Richard) the druid, Panacea (Angèle) the damsel and so on.Obelix has a crush on Panacea. Fu Yi travels to Gaul with Graindemais (Jonathan Cohen) the coach driver and her bodyguard Tat Han (Leanna Chea).
Asterix has a crush on Fu Yi.Fu Yi says that her mother The Empress of China (Linh-Dan Pham) struggled to keep control of the Kingdom after the Emperor's death. The princes covet the throne and pose a threat to Fu Yi's life. Prince Deng Tsin Qin defies the empress and levy's a new tax on his part of the Kingdom. Ri Qi Qi (Manu Payet) is Deng's top advisor. Deng wants to marry Fu Yi, but Fu Yi laughs at the suggestion.The Empress senses danger to Fu Yi's life and seeks help from Epidemais (Ramzy Bedia) who is a western trader in China and claims to be from Gaul. Graindemais is Epidemais's nephew.
As Deng attacks, The Empress asks Epidemais to take Fu Yi to Gaul and away from China. Epidemais entrusts Graindemais to complete the task. The Empress refuses to abandon her country and is captured by Deng, along with Epidemais.Vitalstatistix refuses to help as China is too far away and he finds Fu Yi's story incredulous. Asterix offers to go with Fu Yi to help her and her mother and Obelix decides to accompany him.Meanwhile Julius Caesar is in Rome with Cleopatra (Marion Cotillard). Cleopatra says that she is sick for Julius and will leave him for Tabascos (Florent Manaudou). Ri Qi Qi reaches Caesar's court and offers the riches of China, in exchange for military help.
Cleopatra chides Caesar that outside of Rome, nobody knows him. Caesar is livid and decides to go to China and make a name for himself there. Julius Caesar (Vincent Cassel) takes his army regiments to China to defend Deng Tsin Qin. Caesar and his army get stuck on the silk road.Meanwhile Asterix, Obelix, Tat Han, Fu Yi and Graindemais travel to North Africa by rowing across the Mediterranean.
Graindemais tells Asterix that he loves Fu Yi and is going to marry her. They both start fighting on account of winning the affections of Fu Yi.
The gang travels via the Egyptian desert to reach to the ancient town of Klysma, or modern Suez. At the town, they hire a boatman named Titanix to take them to China. Fu Yi sees the magic of the potion herself when Asterix and Obelix fight a few ruffians in the Suez tavern.The gang comes across the boat of Pirate Asymetrix. This time Tat Han asks Asterix to step back and let her do the fighting. Tat Han defeats the pirates all by herself and sinks their boat. Obelix falls in love with Tat Han.
Meanwhile Caesar's army finds its way through Persia, the Indian mountains and Mongolia to reach at the doorstep of China. Caesar meets Deng and creates a strategy to conquer China.Caesar uses his mighty warrior Caius Antivirus (Zlatan Ibrahimovic) to attack and subdue the Kingdoms opposing Deng. 4 Kingdoms are defeated and the last one standing is the Ku Koo clan.
Fu Yi and her entourage reach China. Asterix tells Obelix that after the adventure he and Fu Yi will stay together in the village and he wants Obelix to move out of the hut as it belongs to Asterix's father, and hence to Asterix. Obelix says that he is happy to move out as he loves Tat Han. Asterix laughs at the suggestion, and they begin to fight.
It is announced that Deng and Caesar will decapitate the Empress in 7 days.Fu Yi and her entourage stays at the residence of Tat Han's master Ban Han. Ban says that the Empress has been held captive at the abandoned Xuan temple. Ban says that after rescuing the Empress, the group has to go to the Ku Koo Kingdom before Caesar is able to defeat it.
Crown Prince Du Deng (Tran Vu Tran) is rumored to be so ugly that he keeps his face covered in bamboo.Tat Han rescues the Empress and the entourage escapes. Epidemais decides to stay back and face the negotiation with his captors for his life.
Fu Yi is sent with Asterix and Obelix to secure the Ku Koo support. While The Empress and Tat Han leave to gather their own supporters and build their army. Because of Obelix's superhuman speed, the trio beat Caesar's legions to Ku Koo's palace.
Far from being hideous, Prince Du Deng is handsome and glorious, with blonde hair. Fu Yi is smitten with Prince Du Deng.Fu Yi and Du Deng have an army of 10,000, against Caesar's 80,000 soldiers. Asterix shares his potion with Fu Yi and Du Deng. But in the middle of battle, Asterix's flask is pierced by an arrow, and he runs out of the potion. Obelix defends Asterix from any attacks from Romans. Despite their best-efforts Fu Yi is captured by the Romans.
This is when The Empress enters the battlefield with her massive army. The whole of China came to defend their land. The Romans surrendered on the spot.
Caesar is forced to retreat.The Empress travels to Gaul to give her thanks to the villagers of Gaul. Du Deng marries Fu Yi.
Obelix dumps Panacea for Tat Han. They have a great party together. But Tat Han returns to China with The Empress and Fu Yi.</p>

Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, Shira and her dedicated INTERPOL team successfully intercept a large drug shipment, angering Gabriel Saban, the powerful mob boss responsible for the illicit operation. Upon Matteo's return to Amsterdam, he learns about the kidnapping of his late friend's daughter by the local crime syndicate led by Gabriel. Fueled by grief and a burning desire to rescue the innocent girl, Matteo embarks on a dangerous mission, engaging in a one-man battle on the streets and canals of the city. Amidst exploding ordnance, flying bullets, and dramatic car collisions, Matteo relentlessly pursues his singular objective: to save the kidnapped daughter and bring down Gabriel's criminal empire.—Frank Liesenborgs</p>

                            <p>Description: Condemned by the tyrannical High Table to be on the run for the rest of his life, deadly assassin maestro John Wick (2014) embarks on a Sisyphean mission of suicidal fury to decide his fate after the merciless carnage in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019). At last, John's violent journey, fuelled by vengeance and grief, ultimately leads him to a fateful confrontation with his former employers, the crime masters that forced him into exile. And as the blood-stained vendetta to destroy those who pull the strings continues, old companions face the brutal consequences of friendship, and all-powerful, well-connected adversaries emerge to bring Wick's head on a platter. But talk is cheap--now guns have the final say. Can Baba Yaga, the grim messiah of death, make every bullet count in this bloody, once-and-for-all struggle for freedom?—Nick Riganas</p>

                            <p>Description: Mahima Basor (Sanya Malhotra) is a competent police officer, but there are often whispers behind her back regarding her caste. She specializes in solving crimes against women and has played a leading role in arresting many women harassers in the area.
Mahima works under SP Angrez Singh Randhawa (Gurpal Singh). News reporter Anuj Sanghvi (Rajpal Yadav) works for the local newspaper.
However, she has learned to ignore them while keeping up with her work. Her goal currently is for her long-term boyfriend, Saurabh (Anant V Joshi), to get promoted from a constable to an inspector so that they can get married. Before that can happen, they get a new case, that of two missing jack-fruits from a local MLA Munnalal Pateria's (Vijay Raaz) house, which they must find at any cost. Mahima rightfully believes that this is a waste of police time and resources, but she has no option but to investigate.Munnalal wanted to gift the pickle made from the stolen jack-fruits to gift to the state CM and his wife who are big fans of jack-fruit pickles. This would improve his chances to get a minister portfolio in the Government. Bindeshwari is Munnalal's wife.
Forensic expert Srivastava (Brijendra Kala) is summoned to investigate. Srivastava takes POP impressions of foot marks around the jack-fruit tree. The prints belonging to a cow are categorized as that of a lady wearing high heel sandals. Constable Mishra (Govind Pandey) is assisting Mahima in the investigations. Constable Kunti Parihar (Neha Saraf) is the female assistant helping Mahima. Kunti is married to Adv. Sunil Parihar (Sanjay Dadhich).Mishra begs Saurabh to marry his daughter. Mishra had fixed her wedding to a family that demands a car as dowry. Mishra had purchased a car, but it was stolen. Now, he has nothing to offer to the perspective groom and hence begs Saurabh.
Anuj meanwhile interviews Munnalal about his missing Jackfruits.Mahima discovers that the gardener Birwa was fired two days ago, and she suspects that he might be the thief. Lucky for her, the gardener himself walks into the police station, wanting to file a missing complaint for his daughter.Upon discovering his identity, Mahima immediately locks him up in a cell and questions him regarding the jack-fruits. It turns out that the gardener was unceremoniously fired after the grandson of the MLA misinterpreted his words and made it sound like he was being threatened by him. But the gardener had been at the police station for a day or two to report his daughter missing.
However, he was turned away by Saurabh, who believed that the girl must have run away of her own accord and would return soon. Mahima is extremely disappointed in Saurabh upon knowing this, as it puts the future of their relationship in greater danger.Mahima desperately wants Saurabh to get a promotion since that would help his parents overlook the caste barrier between them if they were professional equals, at least. But Saurabh indiscriminately beats up some people and is inattentive at his job, which puts Mahima in a difficult position as his boss. She is unable to fully reprimand him owing to their relationship, but she is also unable to trust him as a colleague.Temporarily, regarding the case, Mahima comes up with a solution: the gardener must say that it was his daughter Amiya who stole the jack-fruits so that the police can divert their resources to look for the girl.
The ruse works, and the investigation starts. Mahima finds that several girls have been kidnapped from the area in the recent past.
When they inquire in the gardener's village about her, they find that she was recently kidnapped by three men. Amiya used to consume tobacco, which was sold to her by a local shopkeeper. Under interrogation, the shopkeeper reveals that he had seen Amiya with 3 men selling sunglasses in the village. The 3 men were driving a Nano car.Anuj interviews Birwa and finds the truth that police had lied. Mahima intercepts Anuj and gives him the file of all the kidnapped girls from the area and asks Anuj to cooperate with the police in finding and rescuing Amiya.
Meanwhile, Saurabh redeems himself by finding the address of the people who sold sunglasses in that area. Saurabh had got the list of all mobile numbers active on the day Amiya was abducted. He found that all except 3 numbers were locals. The 3 numbers were registered to the same man, who ran an optical shop with his 3 sons.
The men who kidnapped Amiya (Apoorva Chaturvedi) were also selling sunglasses. As Mahima reaches the optical shop, the owner admits that he had a servant named Bhoora who had all his identity documents. Bhoora ran away from the shop 2 weeks ago. Bhoora had won the owners trust by treating him with a special Khoya Jalebi.Through them, Mahima and her officers discover that these men must have gone to Chhatarpur. They track the CCTV footage of the city and track down the pink Nano that the 3 men were driving.
Anuj leaks the news of 43 kidnappings in the area. SP is livid and orders Mahima to arrest Anuj.Mahima tracks the pink Nano between a fuel pump and a highway Dhaba on the way to Chhatarpur. It is shown that the 3 men are working for Gulab Seth (Raghubir Yadav), who is based out of Panna. They activate the phone to call Gulab, and Mahima is able to track them down. Before Mahima reaches there, the men have departed and their phones are switched off again.
Mahima ultimately figures out that they must go to the house of the man who was the only one in the area to make Khoya Jalebi, Gulab Seth. True to her suspicions, Mahima finds Amiya there, and after a long fight where a lot of vegetables are thrown around, the police capture the culprits.The reason the MLA was so desperate for the jack-fruits was that he needed to make a pickle out of them to impress someone for his own political ambitions. He couldn't get similar jack-fruits in the market since these were grown from imported seeds. Hence, he sought the help of the police to find his missing fruits.Once Amiya is rescued and taken to court, she is further shamed by the lawyers to present her as the kind of person who would steal something unabashedly. The gardener admits that he lied to the media and the police at Mahima's insistence. When Mahima is asked to explain her actions, she tells the court how she was forced to take such a step to focus on the more pressing matter, which was the missing girl rather than a missing fruit. The judge understands Mahima's point and reprimands the police for using their resources for something that barely costs Rs. 360 in the market. Mahima is not charged with anything, and Amiya is also released from custody. Amiya continues leading a life on her terms and has not been deterred by the obsolete thinking of society.On the other hand, the reporter, Anuj (Rajpal Yadav), is released from jail, where he was being held for publishing the news about the girls missing from the area. He takes it as a mark of respect that he was arrested, as he believes that it is a feather in the cap of any reporter. As for Mahima, she is put in charge of a special cell that has been formed with the sole purpose of investigating the cases of the missing girls.
In her personal life, Saurabh gets the promotion he wanted, but Mahima is also made the DSP. An elated Saurabh reassures her that they will not let this become a hindrance to their future.The monkeys around the MLA's house stole the jack-fruits from his tree and are eating them while perched on his rooftop.</p>

He is also friends with Srikanth, Kanaka Mahalakshm's husband. One day, Harika Talwar, Vijay's daughter and R&D head of Syncox Pharma, asks Ravindra to prove her father's innocence. Ravindra investigates the case and finds that there is no concrete evidence against Vijay Talwar such as DNA samples from the crime scene that match Vijay Talwar. He does this to impress Harika as he fell for her at first sight and he convinces the prosecutor of the same.However, ACP Hanumanth Rao, who is retiring soon, is asked to lead the investigation into the Jayaprakash murder and suspects that Vijay is being framed. His team finds a similar case involving a celebrity's murder. Hanumanth goes to the goon Goli Pahelwan and asks to describe what had happened during the murder night of that celebrity. Goli Pahelwan's brother tells what has happened, and coincidentally, it is similar to the murder case they are investigating. Goli Pahelwan says a man came to their house and took the face and body measurements for a statue at Madan Tussade's. They discover that it's Saketh and track him down to his house. When Hanumanth tries to arrest him, Goli Pahelwan comes and saves Saketh. They both drive away and go to kill DIG Narasimha Murthy.

                            <p>Description: My Happy Ending is a poignant and funny female ensemble comedy about four women laughing in the face of adversity, that packs a strong emotional punch. Julia Roth (Andie MacDowell), a somewhat forgotten Hollywood star, discovers she has cancer the day the West End play that was supposed to be her comeback is cancelled - Not fully understanding the magnitude of this discovery, she decides to go to a chemo clinic in Kent, seeking obscurity and privacy, and get it "taken care of" before returning to the US with her tail between her legs. To her horror, having mistaken what the doctor meant by 'private' she finds herself stuck within a general ward with members of the public, three very different women (an aging rocker, a 28-year-old Muslim mother of four, and a forever single retired schoolteacher who doesn't even have a cat), undergoing their usual round of treatment. She calls her manager Nancy to come in and "Fix it", which she promptly does. But as the group let her in on some of the realities she has to look forward to, she realises these strangers are the only ones who can really help her deal with the most difficult role she has ever played - herself.</p>

Seven years later, Rajendran is diagnosed with advanced-stage pancreatic cancer and has only a few more months to live. He decides to reveal his terminal condition and make one of his two elder sons, Jai or Ajay, as the chairman of the company, before his impending death.With this in mind, Rajendran plans to celebrate his 65th birthday in a grand manner, with the intention of announcing both matters during the celebration. Vijay is also invited at the behest of his mother Sudha, who still considers him as her son. Vijay arrives only to find his house in disarray. Jai is cheating on his wife, Aarthi, with another woman, Smitha, and neglecting his family in the process, including his teenage daughter, Ria. Ajay owes a huge amount of money to Mukesh, a financier. When he is not able to repay the money, he offers to leak his company's secrets to his father's business rival, Jayaprakash "JP"; the two elder brothers themselves do not speak with each other and constantly fight for being their father's successor.Meanwhile, Vijay meets Divya, Aarthi's younger sister, who has a crush on Vijay since her childhood. After a few incidents, the duo fall for each other. During Rajendran's birthday celebration, JP and Mukesh reveal the duplicity of Jai and Ajay, which distraughts the entire family, particularly Aarthi, who decides to file for divorce, as well as Rajendran, who has lost a business deal to JP due to Ajay's duplicity. Realising that he cannot rely on his elder sons to run his business empire, Rajendran reaches out to Vijay, who initially refuses, but later agrees to take over the business after learning about Rajendran's terminal illness.In jealousy and dismay, Jai and Ajay leave the house and join hands with JP and Mukesh to get rid of Vijay as the chairman, but Vijay manages to cross the hurdles and neatly handles the family business. After Vijay rescues Ria from human traffickers, Jai realises his mistakes and reconciles with Vijay, Aarthi, and the rest of the family. Vijay and Jai team up to stop Ajay from selling their company's shares to JP, where they make him realise his mistakes. With the whole family now reunited, they have a hearty meal together, much to the happiness of Rajendran and Sudha. When Rajendran dies, the three brothers perform his funeral together and scatter his ashes in Varanasi. Vijay Rajendran ends the film by giving an important message: "No family is perfect, but you have only 1 family".</p>

                            <p>Description: A mute John Doe with the mental capacity of a five-year-old is released from a mental hospital when the state cannot afford his treatment. He begins living on the streets and taking direction from whomever he comes across. While making a biopic about Billy the Kid, the Producer is incensed that method actor Sir Tom Bingsley refuses to leave his trailer. Since this costs the film time and money, the Producer resorts to using a stand-in. The Producer comes across the John Doe selling oranges on the street and hires him due to the striking resemblance to Bingsley. Meanwhile, Lenny is a struggling publicist who has not been able to maintain one client since moving to L.A. and bribes his way onto studio lots to look for talent. Lenny sees John Doe filming the biopic and misunderstands his name to be "Latte Pronto" due to the Producer demanding coffee. After Bingsley dies in a misguided method acting technique of hanging himself, "Billy the Kid" is forced to continue filming with Pronto as the star. Although hindered by Pronto's lack of acting talent and his continued looks directly into camera, his co-stars Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt are inspired by the supposed avant-garde performance and emulate his acting style. Lenny plans to propel Latte Pronto into stardom by getting him an agent and representation. Pronto is befriended by Luxt taking him to wild parties and showing him the Hollywood lifestyle. Simultaneously, Dior becomes infatuated with Pronto due to his sincerity. Dior convinces Pronto to marry her and they adopt several children, increasing their profiles in the media. "Billy the Kid" is a massive success, with critics praising Pronto's performance of breaking the fourth wall by looking into camera. At the after party, Lenny asks Pronto to confirm they will never end their business relationship. When Pronto cannot respond to Lenny's request, a security guard tries to escort Lenny out for disrupting the party. A fight breaks out with Pronto being blamed and sued by the security guard. The Agent asks Pronto to lay low from the media, while informing him of an offer to star in "Mosquito Boy" directed by Lex Tanner. While filming "Mosquito Boy", Pronto is taken out by Luxt for a night on the town which ends with the two in jail after assaulting a paparazzo. Even though Luxt was the aggressor, Pronto is blamed in the media. This further strains his relationship with his representation. While filming "Mosquito Boy", Pronto is injured and a stand-in is used for the majority of the movie. Lenny promises to publicize the film into a big hit regardless. The movie is a colossal failure at the box office and Pronto's representation leaves him. Dior is frustrated with her husband's failing stardom and controversies, so she divorces him, takes the children, and begins dating Luxt. Pronto is forced to move in with Lenny and the two bond over their mutual hardships. Lenny has a heart attack following his consumption of dozens of energy drinks. Pronto stays by his hospital bedside but leaves the room when a fan wants a selfie. Due to a mix-up with a nurse and a deceased patient, Pronto believes Lenny died while Lenny believes Pronto abandoned him. Lenny resolves to become a better person and successful publicist. Meanwhile, Pronto goes back to living on the street. Pronto befriends a homeless man named Dagger and saves his life, gaining media acclaim and is awarded the Key to the City by the Mayor of Los Angeles. The Mayor privately encourages Pronto to run for office on an anti-corporate platform since his acting career is over. The rich and powerful Cote brothers have Pronto kidnapped to discourage his political career. Ed Cote threatens his life should he oppose any of the Cotes' business interests. In return for abandoning politics, Ed Cote arranges for Latte to get his representation back (minus Lenny) and another chance at a movie career. Disillusioned with filmmaking, Pronto abandons his representation and wanders the streets aimlessly. Lenny sees Pronto and chases after him. Lenny apologizes for using his friend as a meal ticket and tells Pronto he loves him. Saying his first words, Pronto responds, "I love you too." The two leave to get dinner together and catch up.</p>

The picturesque office's facade soon starts to crack, with malfunctioning supplies, interchangeable receptionists, and a screaming child they "handle," while BareNaked by Jennifer Love Hewitt blares from the elevator speakers. Trapped, Kat breaks into song-BareNaked of course-in a can't-beat-'em-join-'em gesture, but the ruse doesn't last. She reaches for her pills again, only for the receptionist to pull her in once more, this time successfully bringing her into the cult. Inspired by true events.—Christina Connerton</p>

                            <p>Description: From Wikipedia:
In 1970, eleven-year-old Margaret Simon is informed by her parents Barbara and Herb that the family is moving from New York City to a New Jersey suburb, as her father received a promotion. Margaret is upset about moving away from her friends and Sylvia, her beloved paternal grandmother. She begins to communicate with God about her concerns, anxieties, and hopes.Upon moving to New Jersey, Margaret is quickly befriended by her neighbor and soon-to-be classmate Nancy Wheeler. She welcomes her into her friend group that includes two other girls, Gretchen Potter and Janie Loomis. Margaret's teacher Mr. Benedict gives the class a year-long research assignment. When he learns Margaret dislikes religious holidays, she explains that since her mother is a Christian and her father is Jewish, her family does not observe the holidays and has left it up to Margaret to decide on her own religious identity as she grows older.Prompted by her school assignment, Margaret asks her mother why she has never met her maternal grandparents. Barbara reveals that she is estranged from her devoutly Christian parents Paul and Mary, who disowned her upon her marriage to a Jewish man. On a weekend visit to New York City, Margaret asks Sylvia to take her to temple, which Sylvia gladly does. Meanwhile, Barbara attempts to fit in with the PTA and signs up for multiple committees, which draws her away from her hobby of painting and teaching art.Margaret and her new friends anticipate the milestones of puberty, such as wearing a bra and having their first kisses. At a classmate's birthday party, Margaret enjoys her first kiss with Philip Leroy, a popular boy in her class, during a game of spin the bottle. After viewing a video about menstruation at school, the girls become excited about starting their periods. Margaret grows impatient when other girls get their periods before her, including Gretchen and Nancy. She and Janie buy sanitary pads at a drugstore to be prepared.One night while out with Nancy and her family in New York City, Margaret learns Nancy lied about getting her period earlier when she actually does get her period. At school, Margaret is assigned a group project with Laura Danker, a classmate who is ostracized by her peers (including Nancy) for being taller and more developed. While working together in the library, Margaret brings up rumors about Laura letting boys "feel her up", upsetting her and causing her to storm out. Margaret feels guilty for shaming her, while questioning her friendship with Nancy.For spring break, Margaret wants to visit Sylvia while she is vacationing in Florida, but these plans are interrupted when Paul and Mary reach out to Barbara and say they want to visit and meet Margaret. Upon learning of the cancellation, Sylvia decides to show up at the Simon house with a friend from Florida on the same day of Paul and Mary's visit.After dinner, when Paul and Mary question Margaret about possibly attending Sunday school, Sylvia retorts that Margaret went to temple with her and has already chosen to become Jewish, sparking an argument between the parents and grandparents. Margaret yells at the adults, proclaiming that she does not care about religion and does not even believe in God.Margaret hands in her research paper to Mr. Benedict, wherein she expresses her disillusionment with religion. Soon, she reconciles with her parents and Sylvia. At the end of the school year, Margaret thanks Mr. Benedict for being a good teacher. She also befriends Laura and asks her to dance, with Janie joining them shortly afterwards. Barbara, who has since returned to teaching painting, tells Nancy's mother Jan, the PTA president, that she will no longer volunteer for PTA committees.Just before leaving for summer camp, Margaret talks to Nancy's older brother Evan's friend Moose, a neighborhood boy who mows her family's lawn and whom she has a crush on, and the two agree to spend time together when she returns. At home, she discovers her first period has arrived and excitedly tells her mother. Margaret then resumes her communication with God.</p>

                            <p>Description: On Earth-65 in New York City, over a year after helping defeat Kingpin with Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy relates her struggle to create relationships with anyone around her, feeling isolated in her role as Spider-Woman. After quitting her band, she remembers the last person she felt close to, her best friend Peter Parker. He, along with his Aunt May, was very close to Gwen and her father, Police Captain George Stacy, though she never told any of them about her double life as a superhero. Peter was bullied relentlessly at school, despite Gwen trying to defend him. Unbeknownst to her, he started experimenting with a dangerous chemical. The night of prom, a giant lizard monster attacked the school and tried to kill Peter's bully. Gwen, leaping into action as Spider-Woman, fought him off, causing the building to collapse on top of the creature. The lizard reverted to Peter, who was mortally injured by the rubble. Gwen tried to save him, but it was too late. Peter revealed he knew she was Spider-Woman, and reassured her before dying in her arms. Captain Stacy found her over Peter's body and assumed the masked vigilante murdered him, ordering a city-wide manhunt for Spider-Woman. In the present, Gwen returns home to find her dad, who is still determined to bring down the "killer" of his daughter's best friend. Despite Gwen telling him it's no good, he soon leaves to respond to a disturbance at the Guggenheim Museum. Gwen is soon behind him as Spider-Woman, neutralizing the cops outside and entering to find a parchment-based version of the Vulture has been sucked into her dimension and is wreaking havoc inside. She is pinned down by the villain, but is saved by another inter-dimensional traveler, Miguel O'Hara, a.k.a. Spider-Man 2099, leader of the Spider Society. He tells her that Vulture, and others like him, have been getting sucked into alternate universes ever since the collider incident in Miles' world. His suit and powers are still struggling to subdue the Renaissance Era Vulture, and he uses his artificial intelligence called Lyla to call for backup in the form of Jessica Drew, another Spider-Woman. Together, the three are able to stop Vulture and save the civilians and cops in the area, though Miguel nearly uses a pair of hidden fangs on the creature. Gwen is out of web and injured, and stops to rest. She is found and cornered by Captain Stacy, who tries to take her in. With no other options, she reveals her identity as his own daughter, to his shock. Despite her trying to reason with him and proclaim her innocence of Peter's death, he continues to place her under arrest. He is stopped by Miguel and Jess, who prepare to take the Vulture back to their dimension. Jess convinces a highly reluctant Miguel not to leave Gwen behind all alone, and he allows her to go with them.Several months later in Brooklyn on Earth-1610, a new small time villain named The Spot tries, unsuccessfully, to rob an ATM using his spots, which create portals whose placement he is unable to control his powers. Miles Morales, a.k.a. Spider-Man, arrives to stop him. He does not take the seemingly harmless criminal seriously, as it seems clear he is incompetent and doesn't want to hurt anyone, though Spot insists that he is Spider-Man's nemesis. Before he can explain, Miles gets frantic texts from his parents, Jefferson and Rio, who are waiting for him at school for a meeting with his principle to discuss his collage future. Miles tries to take down Spot quickly, but the haphazard portals lead to a chaotic chase across the city. Miles eventually subdues Spot, but needs to leave to meet his parents. Miles is doing well enough in school, but some of his grades, and all of his extra curricular activities, have suffered from his unexplained absences. His parents are also concerned that he wants to leave for a collage in New Jersey to help study dimensional travel. He leaves suddenly, seeing that Spot has escaped, and Jeff leaves as well, to Rio's annoyance.Jefferson follows Spider-Man, who is back to fighting Spot, the faceless man feeling insulted that Spider-Man thinks of him as low-tier villain. While teleporting all over, the three of them end up in ruins of the Alchemax collider. The Spot tells Spider-Man that this is where they were both created, as Spot used to be a scientist at Alchemax (the one who Miles threw a bagel at in the first film), and ran the test which brought the spider that bit Miles through from another dimension. Likewise, when Miles destroyed the collider, the energy released caused an accident that turned Spot permanently into the humanoid portal creature his is now. The Spot was shunned by his colleagues, friends, and even family for his condition. He becomes enraged, and tries to attack Spider-Man and Lieutenant Morales, but accidentally kicks himself into a deep portal, which closes behind him. Jeff is frustrated that the criminal got away, as well as all the property damage caused by the fight. He confides in Spider-Man about his struggles to be a good father and husband, and the masked Miles awkwardly offers advice before leaving. The Spot finds himself in a void, where he sees many portals made by his spots. Looking through them, he finds he can travel to different dimensions through them, but loses energy and is unable to return to the in-between space. He determines to find a way to get more power to control the void and defeat Spider-Man.Miles continues to try and balance his life as Miles with his responsibilities as Spider-Man. While late to a big party to celebrate his dad's upcoming promotion to police captain, he stops to get cakes, but is constantly waylaid by Spider-Man duties on his way back, missing his father's speech. When he finally makes it, the cakes are ruined, and his parents confront him about his secretive behavior. Miles becomes frustrated trying to come up with an explanation, and snaps at his parents. Rio and Jeff ground him, and Miles storms off to his room. Gwen suddenly appears through a dimensional portal controlled by a watch given to her by Miguel, and she invites him to hang out. They suit up and Gwen tells him all about Miguel's organization, the Spider Society, which she has joined to help protect the various universes. The two patrol the city for a while before stopping to talk, and Gwen confides in him that he is the only friend she's made since her Peter died, as Miles relates his own struggles with the pressure from his parents. He thinks maybe he should just tell them the truth, but Gwen warns against it. As they get closer, Gwen remarks that in every other universe, a version of Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man, though it always ends in tragedy. Miles optimistically states that there may be a first time for the story to end happily. They return to the party where Gwen shows Miles her dimension jumping watch, which also stabilizes her so she doesn't glitch when she is in other worlds. Miles asks her about joining the Spider Society, but she becomes suddenly closed off about the subject and implies that it's a highly specialized and elite group. Jeff and Rio barge in to meet Gwen, immediately disapproving of her friendship with Miles. Gwen has to leave when her watch indicates to her, and Jeff leaves Rio to talk to Miles. They have a heart to heart talk, but, fearing what Gwen told him, Miles still doesn't reveal he is Spider-Man. Rio gives him her blessing to go after Gwen.Miles suits up and tracks Spider-Gwen to an abandoned and recently damaged building, using his powers to turn invisible and follow her inside. She uses her watch to recreate what happened, seeing that Spot made a miniature collider to give him enough power to dimension hop. Gwen freaks out, and is called by Jess, who is angry that Gwen failed to stop Spot before he escaped. She realizes Gwen disobeyed direct orders to stay away from Miles, though Gwen insists she had to see him. She tells Jess that she will leave Miles' dimension forever, and the older Spider-Woman gives her one last chance to get Spot before she tells Miguel. Lyla tracks him, and Gwen uses her watch to go through a portal. Determined to know more about the Spider Society, and feeling lonely without his friends, Miles jumps in after her. They end up in Earth-50101, Mumbatten, a world where New York is a massive metropolis in India. Miles accidentally runs into Gwen while she is chasing Spot, who has gained a great deal more control over his powers and is evading her easily. Miles also meets the local Spider-Man, Pavitr Prabhakar. Pavitr has only been Spider-Man for six months, but is already a member of the Spider Society. Miles starts to spasm due to being displaced from his universe, like the others did the previous year, and nearly gets Gwen hurt when he tries to save her. The three follow Spot to Earth-50101's Alchemax, which houses a fully functional collider. Spot shuts them out with a forcefield and activates the device. Miles uses his Venom powers to steal the energy from the forcefield, but its is too slow and not strong enough. Another Spider person appears and uses his own powers to smash though the barrier, advising Miles on the proper technique. He is Gwen's friend Hobie Brown, a.k.a. Spider-Punk, a British anti-establishment anarchist spider-man. He joins the others in trying to stop Spot from entering the collider, but are too late. As Spot absorbs the power, Miles sees a vision of his father and another policeman being killed during a battle in the city. Spot, now completely covered by the dark portals and unrecognizable, tells Miles that he will have his revenge for what the teen hero's actions have done to him, and escapes dimensions once again. The building starts to collapse and slide down onto Mumbatten, so the four spider people work together to clear the civilians from harms away. As Pavitr tries to save a bus holding his girlfriend, he sees that her father, Police Inspector Singh, is also in danger. Miles goes to rescue him, but Gwen holds him back, saying its too dangerous. Miles goes anyway, and is just able to save the Inspector, to Pavitr and his girlfriend's relief and gratitude. However, a black portal opens up in the heart of the city, and a transport full of other spider people, including Jess, arrives to contain it. Jess orders Gwen, Hobie, and Miles to return with her to HQ. Miles is happy to be let inside the Spider Society, but Gwen is apprehensive.They are transported to Earth-928, Nueva York, a beautiful futuristic world in the year 2099. They enter the Spider Society Headquarters, where Miles sees hundreds of spider people from all different dimensions, including a virtual reality avatar spider-woman named Spider-Byte, controlled remotely by teenager Margo Kess. Confused as to why Gwen told him it was a small group, Miles is given a wristband to prevent him from glitching out. He also sees "anomalies", villains displaced from their own dimensions, who are imprisoned in preparation to be sent home by the Go Home Machine, a device that detects the DNA of the anomalies and sends them to the dimension they came from. They are summoned to see Miguel, and Hobie tells Miles to think carefully about why he wants to be a part of the society, warning him to know what he's fighting for before he accepts their methods. Miguel is furious at Gwen and Miles for letting Spot get away, especially at Miles for interfering. He is interrupted by Peter B. Parker, the Spider-Man who helped Miles the previous year, with his infant daughter Mayday. Gwen takes responsibility, saying she should never have gone to see Miles as she was under orders not to get him involved. Miles want to know what's going on, so Miguel decides to explain the situation to him. He shows him an algorithm containing the details of every universe's Spider-Man, and the things that link each and every one of them together, such as the death of a loved one spurring them to heroism. Miguel explains that these are "canon events" that are essential to every spider-man's universe. These events cannot be changed, or else they will break the canon, leading to devastating consequences. Miguel explains that he himself broke the canon when he tried to replace a version of himself that was murdered, in order to raise that version of him's daughter. However, his interference caused that dimension and everyone in it to fade into nothing. There are other details that many spider people share and can be tracked by the algorithm, one of which being a police captain close to Spider-Man getting killed while trying to save a child. This death has been experienced by Peter B. and Jess, as well as Hobie. It was supposed to happen to Captain Singh in Mumbatten, but Miles saved him, causing the black energy to appear and threaten to swallow the entire world. Gwen was trying to stop him to preserve the algorithm's canon. Miles realizes that his dad will soon be made a captain, and the vision from Spot showed the villain causing Jefferson's death while trying to save a child. Miguel confirms that according to their projections, Miles' father will die in two days, when he is sworn in. Miles wants to go save him, but Miguel will not allow him to, saying it is a sacrifice that all spider people must make, and insisting that to damage the canon too much would cause every dimension to be eradicated. The other spider people surround Miles and tell him the same, even Peter B. and Gwen refuse to interfere. Miles rejects the notion that the algorithm knows exactly what will happen if he tries to save his dad, so Miguel entraps him in a force cage, intending to hold him until the canon event has played out. Hobie reminds Miles of his venom powers, and Miles breaks out of the cage and runs for it. Hobie looks on proudly before quitting the Spider Society and returning to his own dimension.Miguel orders every spider person in the skyscraper to catch Miles, but he is able to evade them into the under city. Peter B. finds him and tries to reason with him, saying he only had the courage to become a father because of Miles, and tries to get him to give up for his own sake. Miles refuses to allow his father to die just because Miguel's algorithm says it is meant to happen, and leaves Peter behind when Miguel tracks them from Peter's watch. Miles escapes onto a train bound for the Moon, but Miguel chases him ruthlessly. He catches him, and furiously tells Miles that he could never be a part of the Spider Society, because he is an anomaly himself; The spider that bit Miles was from another dimension. It was never supposed to bite him, and somewhere there is a world with no Spider-Man at all because of it. Peter B. and Gwen catch up, and accidentally reveal that they were aware of this, leaving Miles feeling betrayed by his own friends. Nevertheless, he uses his venom strike to depower Miguel's suit, telling him that he will never give up, and he has now lured all of the spider people away from the headquarters. He leaves Miguel and the others on the train as he turns invisible and escapes back to HQ. He activates the Go Home Machine, which scans his DNA. Miguel tries desperately to stop him but Spider-Byte lets the machine continue, sending Miles away. Miguel is livid, and orders Jess and Ben, a.k.a. Scarlet Spider, to come with him and hunt Miles down. Gwen questions Miguel in front of everyone, arguing that maybe Miles is right, and perhaps Spider-Man 2099's algorithm doesn't know for certain what will happen if the canon is broken. Miguel uses to Go Home Machine to banish Gwen back to her own dimension. Peter B. and Mayday return to Earth-616 to find his wife, Mary Jane, waiting for them. Peter wonders if he is going to be any good at raising a child after all, but Mary Jane reassures him.Miles arrives in New York, and Gwen is dropped off in Earth-65. Miguel, Scarlet, and Jessica also teleport to New York. Gwen tries desperately to return and find Miles, but her watch has been deactivated. She goes to her apartment to grab her things, but is found by her dad. They finally talk, Gwen explaining why she felt she could never tell him about her alter ego, and George tells her that he is quitting the police force. Gwen realizes that means he will no longer be a captain, and they reconcile. George gives Gwen a package left by Hobie, containing a homemade dimension watch made from parts stolen from the Spider Society. Gwen uses it to jump back to Miles' Earth.Jess, Miguel, and Ben split up to look for Miles, meanwhile Miles is racing through to city to his apartment, contemplating everything the other spider people have told him. He makes it back to his bedroom safely, and is found by his mom. Miles embraces her, rambling about everything that has happened to him since leaving. He decides he will not be afraid anymore, and tells her that he's Spider-Man. Rio, however, doesn't know who Spider-Man is, and goes about her evening. Miles starts to spasm from dimensional displacement, as Gwen arrives at Miles' empty bedroom in Earth-1610. Miles realizes that the Go Home Machine sent him to the dimension the spider who bit him came from: Earth-42. Aaron Davis, Miles' uncle, shows up, still alive in this world, but there is no sign of Jeff, and Rio is working overtime to try and provide for her and her son. Aaron takes Miles with him up to the roof, asking him if he remembers "the plan". As they exit, Miles takes in this version of New York, a crime-ridden, villain ruled, dangerous landscape, and sees that his father has already been killed in this universe. Miles remembers that Earth-42 has no Spider-Man. Aaron gets a text, and before Miles can react, he is knocked unconscious by and unknown figure. Gwen hears Mr. and Mrs. Morales worriedly talking in the other room, and they discuss their feeling of alienation from their son. Gwen appears and tells them it is her fault he has not returned, gaining some respect from Jeff when he learns that her father is a cop. She leaves to find Miles, and Rio asks her to remind him of their love for him when she does.Miles comes to, tied up in Aaron's apartment. he tries to explain that he is from another universe, one where his father is alive and Aaron is dead. He appeals to Aaron's better nature, saying his uncle never truly wanted to be the Prowler. Aaron tells Miles that he isn't the Prowler, but shows him the person who is: Earth-42's Miles Morales. Prowler Miles is fascinated by his story, and Miles pleads with his counterpart to release him so he can save their father. However, Prowler Miles has no intention of letting him go.Gwen puts together her own team to find and rescue Miles, including Hobie, Pavitr, Margo, Peter B. and Mayday, Peni Parker and her robot SP//dr, Spider-Man Noir, and Spider-Ham. As they use Hobie's homemade portals to start their mission, Miles starts to charge up his venom.</p>

                            <p>Description: Reina Cole has been paying her dues at the law firm Horowitz & Associates over the past seven years, and is finally up for a major promotion. Even though she has put up with numerous racial microaggressions as the only lawyer of color in the office, she's confident that her excellent work performance will prove that she's more than qualified. But when the junior white attorney that Reina mentored lands the position instead, she questions the decision and is blatantly dismissed. Reina tries to remain professional, but being overlooked and undervalued triggers anger suppressed from her childhood. Reina's parents, Cassandra and Donald, have always favored their younger daughter, Reilly, and consistently remind Reina to not be the "angry black woman" at the firm. The mounting pressure to be perfect in her parents' eyes and uphold the family's image slowly begins to wreak havoc on Reina's mental state. Her random outlandish and comical daydreams that include beating up her boss or cussing out her white colleagues become more and more frequent. Even her usual stress reliever, kickboxing, isn't enough. Reina's best friend, Jillian, co-worker, Garth, and boyfriend, Carlo, all take notice of Reina's unpredictable mood swings and encourage her to seek therapy. Reina isn't convinced she needs professional help until Carlo breaks up with her after she loses her temper and causes a scene in public. Reina now has to resolve the issues that have been festering beneath the surface for many years.

                            <p>Description: With his mother's gloomy spectre looming over his entire life, grizzled outcast Beau has never made sense of his miserable existence. And perpetually baffled by reality and his conflicting urgent needs, the neurotic New Yorker gets a hearty slice of crippling anxiety and sheer paranoia when he sets foot in a strangely familiar war zone: his neighbourhood. But as the pill-popping hermit reluctantly embarks on a Sisyphean quest for answers, determined to reunite with his estranged mum at all costs, Beau must summon every last ounce of courage to confront everything that has kept him in the dark. To have a fighting chance of deciphering the sinister secrets that continue to rule his life, Beau must grapple with deep-seated phobias, deal with heavy guilt, and face the menacing parent. Because, in his case, love was a fiendish trap--the labyrinthine depths of maternal affection were only the means to an end. Now, the drugs don't work, and Beau is afraid. As the universe conspires against his conquest and the end draws near, will Beau be able to fight his inner demons for a change?—Nick Riganas</p>

This film examines the hidden struggles of American families, the calculated political maneuvers of the elite, and the long overdue uprising of American workers. With affection for the middle-class and the outrageous attempt to color them as lazy, the film explores the question: How do we make sure workers are paid what they are worth, instead of believing they are only worth what they are paid?—Jillian Hurley</p>

She is quite close with her mother Diane who lives in a large house alone but doesn't seem to have a clear direction for her life other than writing. Diane plays cards frequently with older family members.At one event early in the movie, Kate's friend and co-worker Janie spills wine on herself and needs a replacement shirt, which Diane brings.Later, Janie and Kate are at their favorite pub.After one wedding, Kate sees an affluent couple having trouble getting their BMW started. Bruce, a man about Diane's age who is a lot more laid-back, finds the problem and fixes it. As Bruce is leaving, Kate hands him her mother's phone number, not really expecting anything to result.Diane shows up and disrupts the yoga class Janie and Kate attend.Soon, Diane is talking about a mystery man. This man hasn't met Kate. But one day Kate is spending time with Diane and they are expecting a food delivery. Bruce is sending Kate text messages indicating he is ready to meet Kate is on his way. Diane tries to discourage him. But he shows up anyway with the food. It turns out he is the delivery person. Then he tells Kate that he is the man in Diane's life and that he is happy to meet Kate.It has only been six weeks, but after Kate leaves, Bruce proposes. Kate forgot something and had to come back, and she sees her mother opening a ring box. This upsets her.Kate needs to calm down as she is driving home and she tries meditation, which distracts her from what she is supposed to be doing. She nearly hits Josh who is crossing the street and falls into a flower bed. Kate stops to check on him and he is all right. They have a conversation and she learns he is an optometrist who lives in her neighborhood.Kate attends one wedding as a guest and sees a man wearing Chuck Taylors who might be ideal for her.Once Kate accepts the idea that her mother is marrying a man she has known only a short time, they go dress shopping. The salesperson naturally assumes Kate is the bride, which is embarrassing. Several other mothers and daughters are also there. Diane tries on several dresses and finally settles on one.Kate takes the dress home to her apartment. However, she can't resist trying it on. She falls asleep wearing the dress. The next morning her mom shows up unexpectedly and Kate can't get the dress off. She can't let her mom see her wearing it, so she sneaks out the window and heads to Josh's apartment. Josh lets her in and helps her get the dress off. However, Kate has nothing on under the dress, so she has to borrow clothes from Josh. Kate also learns that Josh not only cooks, but butchers his own chickens. They then go to her favorite pub, which is also Josh's favorite pub. This could be a problem if they become a couple and then break up, so they have to decide who will get custody if that happens.Bruce and Diane consider getting married at the venue where Kate works because it is very nice and they won't have to pay as much because Kate works there. There won't be an opening until September. Kate agrees to officiate. Later, it turns out there has been a cancellation and Bruce and Diane can get married in three weeks. Kate thinks that is too soon.Bruce and Kate spend some time together getting to know each other at the lake where he lives.Bruce and Diane go on a date at a really nice restaurant and that happens to be where Josh and Kate go on their first real date. They all join a group that is playing Twister. Josh discovers his very pretty ex-girlfriend is part of the group.Kate is shocked to learn Diane wants to sell her house. However, Diane will move in with Bruce at his house on the lake. But Diane doesn't move in right away. Once she gets the house cleared out, she takes her essentials with her to Kate's place. They have trouble getting along in such a small space, and there are even doubts whether Bruce and Diane will actually get married.Kate is upset with her life in general and even suggests to Josh that whatever the status of their relationship is, maybe they shouldn't see each other any more.After seeing Josh with his ex, Kate has doubts about whether there is a chance for her and Josh. Meanwhile, Bruce and Diane make up, and the wedding is back on.Janie takes a job in Boston. Kate is sorry to see her go.Kate officiates at the wedding, as planned, and things go well.

                            <p>Description: Poison, the final short film from Wes Anderson (adapted from Roald Dahl's short story of the same name), is kind of a mixed bag. First things first, I don't think I have much to say about Poison, as I have discussed Anderson's style in my reviews of The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and The Ratcatcher. Like those short films, this one, too, consists of multiple narrators and the director moves between them with self-assurance. This confidence is one of the most seductive things about Anderson's films. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, all four shorts could have easily collapsed under the weight of their narrative ambition. But in Anderson's hands, even the least successful stories (Henry Sugar and The Swan) don't completely sag, though they look unnecessary and overwhelming.—yusufpiskin</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2012, the brightest star in all of sports was an undersized freshman quarterback at unheralded Texas A&M, whose fervor on the field was rivaled only by his hard-partying ways off it. Dubbed "Johnny Football," the magnetic football player captured the nation's attention and initially relished his alter ego: "I wanted to be Johnny Football. Johnny Football never had a bad time," he says. But as the money rolled in, the scrutiny heightened, and Manziel rejected his newfound fame and suddenly lost his way. With astonishing candor, Manziel along with his family, coaches, his former best friend, and his agent details what happened behind the scenes as scandals piled up in the glare of paparazzi flashbulbs. He fumbled his shot at NFL success after the Cleveland Browns picked him in the first round of the NFL draft in 2014, but Manziel went on to search for something even greater: inner peace and happiness with a quieter life that he reveals here.</p>

But to colonize space, the unholy match of government and private companies will first need an army to help build their new spaceship oasis. A stranger, Terrance arrives to recruit Junior, but not Hen, and given little time to enjoy their days together, the pair faces uncertainty about their relationship and future. Terrance offers them one bit of solace: there will be a flesh-and blood-clone of Junior here on Earth to keep her company once the real Junior leaves for space.—lament</p>

                            <p>Description: Paris, France, 1935. With a wide assortment of debt collectors lining up at her door, struggling actress Madeleine Verdier is with her back to the wall. But life is full of surprises. And then, for no apparent reason, someone puts a bullet in the head of the lascivious French producer, Montferrand. As a result, as if the cruel hardships of poverty weren't enough, the penniless artist now stands accused of murdering one of the city's most famous residents. Luckily, Madeleine's roommate Pauline Mauléon happens to be a lawyer. Of course, the prime suspect claims to be innocent; however, the truth is in the eye of the beholder. What happens if the producer's shocking murder isn't Madeleine's crime?—Nick Riganas</p>

                            <p>Description: Much has been written, but little is known about Johannes Vermeer, painter of iconic paintings and crowd pleasers such as The Milkmaid and Girl with a Pearl Earring. His small oeuvre is almost everything he left behind. Close to Vermeer follows Gregor Weber, a globally renowned Vermeer expert and flamboyant curator at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In the year before he retires, he works on his big dream: the largest Vermeer exhibition ever. Together with Weber, a number of Vermeer enthusiasts and experts go in search of what truly makes a Vermeer a Vermeer. Through new discoveries and by dissecting the work layer by layer, this film brings us closer to the painter to understand the decisions he made and the steps in his oeuvre.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1998, Shiva is a happy-go-lucky police constable, who along with his girlfriend Revathi, a driving instructor, decide to elope and get married. However, Shiva gets involved in a road rage case and arrests Rajasekhar alias "Raju", a dreaded gangster who does dirty jobs for CM Dakshayani and her party. George, who is imprisoned by Shiva, tells him that he is a CBI officer who has to produce Raju in court situated at Bangalore in 48 hours, as Raju has useful information regarding Dakshayani's involvement in a orchestrated bomb blast at Morampudi in order to overthrow a state government run by a regional party. Shiva calls Varghese and confirms the same. It is later revealed that Shiva's elder brother, Vishnu, was one of the victims of the Morampudi bomb blast as he was rescuing innocent bystanders. Shiva had later joined the force in order to fulfill his brother's dream of becoming a sub-inspector (SI).Meanwhile, chief minister Dakshayani learns of Raju's arrest and assigns some goons and IG Nataraj to kill him. Nataraj and Dakshyini's goons try to kill Raju and George, but Shiva subdues the goons and escapes with them. Shiva, Raju and George head to Bangalore, where Revathi also accompanies them. Nataraj tracks them down where their car fell into a lake near a dam. Shiva, Raju, Revathi and George sneak into the dam's underground tunnel, where Nataraj attacks them and George is killed in a crossfire. After escaping from Nataraj, Shiva, Revathi and Raju go to the hospital, as Raju was injured during the previous shootout, but the hospital is watched by Nataraj's men.Later, the trio arrive at Maj. Gen. Philips Satya Raj and Raju gets operated. After this, the trio are escorted by officers under Varghese's orders, but Nataraj and his goons surround them. Shiva and Raju fight the men, and Philips also arrives and helps Shiva and the others to escape. Due to sudden circumstances in which the trio run into Revathi's family, Raju escapes and arrives at a fair, but Shiva manages to find him. Nataraj arrives and tells Shiva to kill Raju in exchange for his father's life. However, Shiva's father tells Shiva to leave and get justice for Vishnu. He then shoots himself, killing him. Shiva escapes again with Raju and Revathi. At the railway station, the trio are attacked by Raju's brother Ravi, who was bribed by Dakshayani to kill him in exchange for taking Raju's place. A fight ensues where Raju kills Ravi.Shiva, Revathi and Raju board the train to Bangalore. Nataraj and his men follow them. A fight ensues where Raju separates from the compartment in order to save Shiva. Nataraj kills Raju, thus leaving Shiva devastated. The next day at the court, it is revealed that Shiva actually recorded Raju's confession about Dakshayani's involvement in the bomb blast, and shows the evidence in the court. Raju also confessed that Dakshayani had murdered an IAS officer who was investigating her and used the bomb blast to cover up his death. Raju tells that he did all this for Dakshayani because he had a crush on her, as he told to Revathi earlier. Dakshayani, Nataraj and other officers involved are arrested. Varghese thanks Shiva and offers him a position in the CBI, but he declines and decides to continue being in the police force. After this, Shiva and Revathi plan for their marriage.</p>

                            <p>Description: Part 1: Accusations and Confrontations
The story commences with a mysterious summons received by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist known for his instrumental role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. The summons thrusts him into the spotlight as he is called to appear before a secretive government committee. The allegations against him remain shrouded in secrecy but hint at suspicions of communist sympathies. The film masterfully intertwines the present-day hearings with poignant flashbacks that reveal pivotal moments in Oppenheimer's life.Flashback 1: The Early Years
We are transported to the 1930s, a time when Oppenheimer was associated with communist organizations and individuals. The audience witnesses his complex relationships, including that with Haakon Chevalier, a close friend and fellow physicist who shares his political ideals. This period also showcases Oppenheimer's burgeoning career in physics, establishing him as a brilliant scientist and intellectual.Flashback 2: The Manhattan Project
The film seamlessly transitions to the frenzied atmosphere of World War II. Oppenheimer's involvement in the top-secret Manhattan Project, along with luminaries like Albert Einstein, General Leslie Groves, and Ruth Tolman, is depicted in vivid detail. The moral dilemmas surrounding the creation and use of the atomic bomb emerge, hinting at the seeds of doubt that would later haunt Oppenheimer.Part 2: The Intense Hearings
Back in the present, the audience becomes immersed in the hearings' intensity. A gallery of characters, including Roger Robb, a relentless interrogator, and Dr. David Hill, a scientist who opposes Oppenheimer's political stance, contribute to the tense and emotionally charged atmosphere. The relentless questioning and cross-examinations reveal the depth of Oppenheimer's character and resilience.Part 3: Personal Turmoil and Doubts
As the hearings progress, Oppenheimer's personal life begins to unravel. His wife, Kitty, struggles to support him while grappling with her own doubts about his associations with communist groups. The film explores the emotional toll of the hearings on the Oppenheimer family and the strains on their relationships.Part 4: The Verdict and Fallout
The film reaches its climax when the committee delivers its verdict. Despite the absence of concrete evidence tying Oppenheimer to espionage, his association with communist sympathizers and his ambiguous stance on the development of the hydrogen bomb result in the denial of his security clearance. This devastating blow to his career and reputation leaves Oppenheimer and his supporters stunned.Part 5: Reflection and Legacy
In the aftermath of the verdict, Oppenheimer reflects on his choices and the profound sacrifices he made for science and his country. The film delves deep into the moral and ethical quandaries faced by those who shape history. It also highlights the complex legacies of Oppenheimer's scientific contributions and the haunting questions they raise about humanity's power over its own destiny.</p>

                            <p>Description: Detective Travis Hurley arrives in a small town in the Australian outback. The Hotel Limbo, which resembles a rocky grotto, proves to be perfect for his very own particular type of relaxation. But he has come here to investigate a case from 20 years ago for which the only evidence is a number of tape recordings: the unsolved murder of an Aboriginal girl named Charlotte Hayes. The residents are less than forthcoming regarding the provision of information; this is especially true of the victim's fractured family. You do not talk to a cop, especially if he is white. But Hurley, in a stoic performance by Simon Baker, knows how to wend his way in his cool car through the labyrinthine landscape of the Opal Mountains and form a bond with the cave and caravan dwellers. Indigenous Australian film director Ivan Sen is renowned for his depiction of magnificent screen landscapes. In Limbo, he juxtaposes the low sky with the mounds above and holes below ground around the opal-mining capital of Coober Pedy. The result is a serene "desert noir" that is as convincing as a detective story as it is a subtle portrait of the First Nation's deep-seated experiences of everyday racism. A genre film suffused with bleak nostalgia.—Official Summary C</p>

                            <p>Description: D'Artagnan, a young man from Gascony, is almost killed trying to stop a young woman from being kidnapped, by a mysterious older woman and her henchmen. He then travels to Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard. D'Artagnan visits Capitaine de Tréville, commander of the musketeers at its headquarters. Tréville, who knew D'Artagnan's late father, says he will write him a letter of introduction. D'Artagnan sees one of the men who tried to kill him in the street below, and rushes out of the building to confront him, but, in so doing, unintentionally offends three musketeers, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, who each demand satisfaction; D'Artagnan decides to fight a duel with each of them that afternoon.As D'Artagnan prepares himself for the first duel, he realizes that Athos's seconds are Porthos and Aramis, who are astonished that the young Gascon intends to duel them all. They admire and respect his fearlessness. As D'Artagnan and Athos begin, Cardinal Richelieu's guards appear and attempt to arrest D'Artagnan and the three musketeers for illegal dueling. Although they are outnumbered four to five, the four men win the battle. After learning of this, King Louis XIII of France upbraids the musketeers. D'Artagnan becomes friends with The Three Musketeers and discovers that Porthos is bisexual. He finds lodgings and falls in love at first sight with Constance Bonacieux, a sentiment which she comes to reciprocate. She works for Queen Anne of France, who is secretly having an affair with the English Duke of Buckingham, and thus cheating on her husband, Louis XIII, and such betrayal, if discovered, which is what Cardinal Richelieu desires, would lead to her beheading.Many of the king's advisers and his younger brother are urging him to fight the Protestants rebels at La Rochelle. Richelieu plots with the mysterious older woman, called Milady, to undermine the Queen.Athos is falsely accused of murdering a young prostitute (who is found totally naked, with mutliple stab wounds, next to him in bed) and sentenced to death. D'Artagnan realises it was the young woman he tried to save from being kidnapped, and the musketeers resolve to find out who she is, so they can save Athos. D'Artagnan goes to the House of Valcour to talk to a family they believe is connected to the woman. Milady is there pretending to be a member of the family. Milady attempts to kill him, but D'Artagnan eludes her. Athos is freed on the way to his execution by his younger brother, Benjamin, who is in hiding with his seceding Protestant allies, Saint-Blancard and Brandicourt.The King gives the queen a gift of diamonds, but she gives them to her lover, Lord Buckingham, as a keepsake. The King hears rumors of the affair and demands that the queen wear the diamonds to his brother's wedding. Constance sends D'Artagnan to England to fetch the diamonds from Buckingham. Milady steals them from Buckingham but D'Artagnan chases after her and retrieves them. Milady jumps off a cliff to get away. D'Artagnan returns the jewels to Queen Anne just in time to save her honor.At the wedding of Gaston, Duke of Orléans and Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, Huguenots rebels, including Athos' brother, try to assassinate the King, but Athos and the rest of the musketeers save him. The King pardons Athos.At the end of the film, the first installment, D'Artagnan is knocked unconscious in a street by one of Milady's henchmen whilst trying to save Constance from being kidnapped.</p>

The film centers around Sebastian (Maniscalco) who is encouraged by his fiancée (Leslie Bibb) to bring his immigrant hairdresser father Salvo (De Niro) to a weekend get-together with her super-rich and exceedingly eccentric family (Kim Cattrall, Anders Holm, Brett Dier, David Rasche). The weekend develops into what can only be described as a culture clash, leaving Sebastian and Salvo to discover that the great thing about family is everything about family.—Lionsgate</p>

                            <p>Description: After the Kargil war, Pakistan unleashed an intelligence campaign aimed at influencing the outcome of the upcoming elections in Bangladesh.A woman named Heena is killed by Brigadier Mirza, after she gifts him a bottle of perfume. Mirza had received a phone call which revealed that the perfume had poison in it. Mirza stabs Heena in the neck and kills her.Krishna is distraught at Heena's death and blames her boss Jeev for killing Heena. But Jeev retorts that it was Krishna who was responsible for Heena's death.
Krishna remembers how Heena had first approached her and offered to work for her in exchange for generous payments. Heena says that she has connections in Bangladesh and offers her schedules of Brigadier Mirza's movement for the next 15 days. Heena says that she hates Mirza as he is a stooge for the ISI.As Heena's intelligence is proven correct, Krishna recruits her into operation Ghalib. But Heena suspects that she is being watched. Krishna visits Heena's home where she lives with her father. Heena tries to kiss Krishna and she runs away. Eventually, they have sex together.In the present, Krishna blames Jeev for sending Heena on a suicide mission without discussing with her. Jeev says that someone betrayed the agency and revealed Heena's mission to Mirza.Krishna Mehra (Tabu) is an operative at the Research & Analysis Wing grappling with her dual identity as a spy and a lover. She is assigned to track down the mole selling India's defense secrets. KM and her boss Jeev (Ashish Vidhyarthi) establish that Ravi Mohan (Ali Fazal) whose lavish lifestyle does not match his income must be the mole and suspect his wife Charu (Wamiqa Gabi) to be his partner is delivering secrets.
Jeev finds that Ravi photocopies top secret documents and takes them with him in his briefcase. Charu is found to be very friendly with the wives of the diplomats of the Pakistani agency at a local club where she takes her son for swimming lessons. The same club is frequented by many diplomats and is an ideal meeting point. She is suspected to work as courier for Ravi.
Jeev offers KM the chance to avenge Heena's death.Shashank (Atul Kulkarni) is KM's ex-husband and Vikram (Meet Vohra) is her son.
They obtain permission to have Ravi's house electronically bugged. After some perseverance, they start finding out how things are being operated.
Ravi's mother Lalita (Navnindra Behl) lives with him. Ravi and Lalita visit a local Baba Yaara (Rahul Ram) quite frequently.
Through their observation, they find Ravi talking to Lalita about the files. The next day Ravi brings Lalita a load of cash, which indicates that the delivery has been completed. But KM knows that Charu did not make the delivery as she was in the club and all she found in Charu's folder was her son's report cards.
Jeev figures out that every Monday Ravi spends 4 extra minutes in the garage, while returning from work, before climbing the stairs of his house. Jeev orders that cameras be installed in the garage.Krishna figures out that the documents are picked up from the boot of Ravi's car, scanned and copied to a flash drive and delivered to US ambassador Rachel McClane (Jan Graveson), when she comes for her daily run at an ancient ruin.
Jeev correctly deducts that the US intelligence agency had knowledge of India's operations in Dhaka. They pressurized Home Minister Naren Mishra (Lalit Parimoo) to give up their operative in Dhaka, since the US wanted Osama and any Indian operation in Dhaka would jeopardize that. Rachel had told Naren that US will call off the nuclear deal with India, if India does not cooperate. Naren knows that CIA is behind exposing every Indian asset to Islamabad.
When confronted by Jeev, Naren accepts that the nuclear deal was more important than Brigadier Mirza.Meanwhile Ravi discovers the cameras in his house and tries to flee. Charu realizes that Ravi has betrayed his country. Charu refuses to go with Ravi and Lalita. Charu is shot in the process by Lalita but survives as KM's team reaches there on time and gets her to the hospital.
When Charu recovers, she understands that Ravi has taken their son with him and along with his mother, has sought refuge in the US.6 months pass. Charu has vague memories of who saved her that night when Ravi escaped. She looks at Ravi's official photos and recognizes KM's bracelet as the bracelet of the person who saved her. Charu begs KM to get her son back for her.KM trains Charu and sends her to the US. KM's training includes how to beat a lie detector test.
Charu tracks down Lalita via Yaara Baba who was touring US, and Lalita was still visiting him regularly. Yaara convinces Lalita that Charu is clean, as he was under pressure from KM who had blocked all of Yaara's accounts.
Ravi is not convinced and feels that he should report Charu to the CIA. He believes that Yaara could have been bought by the agency. Lalita is sick of doing housework and they have no money left, she forbids Ravi from revealing Charu's presence to the CIA.
Charu starts to blend back in and make Ravi and his mother believe that she just wants to be with them.
Charu beats the lie detector test of the CIA and through her own bugs, she knew that the CIA was keeping an eye on her.In the flashback, Krishna Mehra finds herself getting drawn to Heena (Azmeri Haque Bandhon) but distances herself on discovering her true identity of a double agent for Pakistan's ISI. Heena claims that she joined the ISI to help KM.
To prove her love to KM, Heena accepts a suicide mission to kill Mirza from Jeev, but it is compromised by Ravi and Rachael.
Heena gets killed by Brigadier Mirza (Shataf Figar) after finding out there was poison in the perfume bottle, she gifted him.Turns out KM was right next to Charu in the US. She saves Charu from ISI spies keeping an eye on her. Through spying her family KM finds that Mirza is coming to the US to visit his daughter. The CIA handler tells Ravi that he and Mirza will have dinner at Ravi's house.
Jeev orders KM not to kill Mirza. KM confronts Ravi with video footage of him meeting a confirmed CIA handler. KM says that if the video is released, the CIA will deport Ravi.
KM wants Ravi to poison Mirza's food and return to the country with honor.The dinner is set. KM lures the CIA handler out of Ravi's house by cutting the power to his house. But Mirza senses a trap when he realizes that he is the only one about to eat dinner and the others have made one excuse or the other. Mirza takes Lalita hostage and cuts her neck. In a rage, Ravi attacks Mirza just as KM arrives at their house. KM stops Ravi from killing Mirza.KM makes a deal with the CIA handler. Mirza is killed and the Mohan family is deported to India.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lori-Jo - LJ to her friends - and Tory are best friends and coworkers. Christmas is LJ's favorite time of the year, while Tory is more practically oriented to think much about the holidays. That's why LJ, in an ultimatum from her boss, quits instead of works over the holidays in determined not to put off her Christmas plans yet again this year, namely to head to Yuletide Springs, a town that does Christmas year round. In a promise to her now deceased Grandmother, LJ plans to hang the Christmas tree ornament they made together on the public Christmas tree in the town square on Christmas Eve. LJ is able to convince a reluctant Tory to accompany her, she planning on working remotely without telling said boss that she's actually leaving town, that reluctance despite Tory truly disliking her job. With it being a several day drive away, LJ has a set schedule to arrive in Yuletide Springs early, that schedule to provide some cushion if anything goes wrong on the road. A car problem early on in their trip is just a harbinger of the delays they face. The common factor in all the delays is an elderly man calling himself Kris Kringle who seems to imply to them that they should not let the unexpected things in life pass them by, especially in the magic of Christmas. Kris seems to be able to work his magic so that along the way LJ makes a connection with garage owner Zack, and Tory with Jason, who has already made the decision to stop and smell the roses in focusing on what is important to him in life. The questions become how Kris' magic will affect LJ making it to Yuletide Springs on time, and if Kris truly is who he makes himself out to be, something that LJ and eventually Tory end up believing.—Huggo</p>

Under an unusual amount of international pressure and scrutiny, this film highlights the personal struggles of the main characters involved in the hunt for Lucie Blackman's kidnapper as they uncovered the sordid crimes of a culprit who challenged and toyed with them at every stage of the investigation.

                            <p>Description: Working for the boutique New York City-based agency Colvin Designs, theme park designer Tim Ericson and his native South African videographer Darius D'Checko have just arrived at the Ukubuyela Endle Wildlife Reserve in South Africa for a three week stay to conduct research for their next project, an immersive wildlife adventure themed attraction. There, they meet wildlife rangers, American Megan Henry, who works part-time while she completes her Ph.D. dissertation in big cat ethology, she close to doing her defense, and South African Kamara, who is nearing the end of her training. Getting off on the wrong foot in Tim and Darius unwittingly contravening what to them seems like a benign policy of no drones, one which does have important reasons for being in place and, if contravened, could risk Megan and Kamara their ranger licenses and thus their livelihoods, Tim and Megan, and Darius and Kamara embark on burgeoning romances, ones that will last probably at least for the duration of Tim and Darius' stay. As Tim and Megan seemingly reach the next stage of possible commitment, a stage that Megan cannot see happening in they just being in the wrong phases of their respective lives, their romance is already threatened with the arrival onto the scene of Amy Bradshaw, Tim's former college classmate who he has not seen in ten years since their college days and more importantly his ex-girlfriend. While Amy states her presence is to provide him the courtesy of the news that her father has purchased Colvin Designs and has placed her as head of the theme park division making her Tim's new boss, she has ulterior motives for wanting to see Tim in person. And as "boss" that is on the scene, she may have sway in what Tim and Darius decide to do to get what they need, policies be damned.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Tommy Olson is seeing things again. He can't make out what it is, just like what he told the police that one fateful night that deadly accident occurred. Tommy can't shake the thought of a darkness following him since that night, and that there's someone moving in the shadow of his every step. Maybe that's why he's not performing so well in law school. That, or the fact his father, brilliant former defense attorney Dan Olson, is also his teacher. Exhausted from the pressures from his mom, two sisters at home, and his father's bullying at school, he graduates and makes an effort to carve his own path. Tommy feels the only way he can measure up, is if he pushes himself to join a law firm separate from his father's connections, in the prying eyes of his family. But a dark force surrounds the Midwest suburb, and people from his past who are reported dead by a mysterious killer, who is stalking them at random. The visions of deathly premonitions become stronger as Tommy starts his first day as part of the new law firm. Tommy meets Olivia and it was a welcome romantic interest that pulls him away from the chaos of his life. The sparks between them are quickly snuffed out by blood soaked memories unlocking in his mind. Tommy must decide whether to share these visions with her or to keep a secret. He can't help but feel he is being shoved into a sinister puzzle he does not want to put together because he just may be, the last piece.</p>

To top it all off, the property is not very comfortable, cook Helen's skills cannot hide that, and the methods of the young seminar leader Rebecca also seem rather questionable. When first the Lord's favorite peacock and then the Lady's favorite goose disappear, further arguments and chaos are inevitable. And finally it starts to snow.</p>

When it aired on the night of Dec. 3, 1968, the special became the most-watched television event of the year, and nearly half of the entire TV-watching audience tuned in to see Elvis Presley, clad in an iconic black leather suit, deliver some of the greatest performances of his life, reinvigorating his career and changing the pop-culture landscape forever. Told from the unique perspective of Emmy® Award-winning television director Steve Binder, REINVENTING ELVIS: THE '68 COMEBACK features interviews with Elvis experts recollections from those who attended the special in-person, as well as all-new versions of iconic Elvis hits interpreted by contemporary musicians, including superstar Daris Rucker, Latin GRAMMY® winner Maffio, and America's Got Talent finalist Drake Milligan, who previously starred in CMT's hit series Sun Records, also streaming on Paramount+.—Paramount+</p>

                            <p>Description: THE OLD OAK is a special place. Not only is it the last pub standing, but it's also the only remaining public space where people can meet in a once thriving mining community that has now fallen on hard times after 30 years of decline. TJ Ballantyne (Dave Turner) the landlord hangs on to The Old Oak by his fingertips, and his predicament is endangered even more when the pub becomes contested territory after the arrival of Syrian refugees who are placed in the village without any notice. In an unlikely friendship TJ meets a curious young Syrian Yara [Ebla Mari] with her camera. Can they find a way for the two communities to understand each other? So unfolds a deeply moving drama about their fragilities and hopes.—yusufpiskin</p>

                            <p>Description: The film begins with The Narrator (Helen Mirren) explaining the societal impact of the Barbie doll on history, accompanied by a clip of the original 1959 Barbie towering over a desert landscape, while little girls playing with baby dolls begin to destroy them.Hidden from the real world is Barbieland, where the Barbies and Kens, alongside other dolls like Allan (Michael Cera) and Midge (Emerald Fennell), live. The Barbies preside over Barbieland in a matriarchal system and work high-position jobs while the Kens spend time as futile subordinates living in the Barbies' shadow. Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling) has feelings for Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) and constantly vies for her attention, but she doesn't recognize.During a dance party at her house, (Stereotypical) Barbie suddenly starts questioning her mortality. The next day, Barbie suffers an existential crisis, experiencing a series of mishaps including her perfect skin with blemishes and her arched feet going flat. The other Barbies suggest she visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), who informs her the human girl who is playing with her is unhappy. To fix her crisis, Barbie must travel to the real world, find the girl and help her.On her way to the real world, Barbie finds (Beach) Ken stowed away in her car. He convinces her to let him join and the two travel to Los Angeles, where they accidentally get arrested several times. Barbie learns to cry upon taking in how flawed the real world is, before complimenting an old woman on her beauty. Ken wonders off and discovers the patriarchy, feeling accepted for the first time. He excitedly travels back to Barbieland.At a local school, Barbie finds her human girl, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), and tries to help her. However, Sasha and her friends condemn Barbie for glorifying bimbo culture and unhealthy life goals, causing Barbie to run off in tears. Meanwhile, the Mattel CEO (Will Ferrell) discovers Barbie's existence and orders her deportation to Barbieland, sending his men after her.Barbie arrives at Mattel Headquarters and meets the CEO and his male subordinates. They try to send her back via a life-sized doll box, but Barbie deduces their intention and escapes in a pursuit. She is helped by Sasha and her mother Gloria (America Ferrera), who is revealed to be the incitement for Barbie's worries. Gloria started playing with Barbie during a midlife crisis, relinquishing her concerns over to Barbie. The trio, unaware they are being followed by the CEO and his colleagues, travel back to Barbieland.Arriving in Barbieland, the three find that Ken has led his fellow Kens in overthrowing the system, enslaving the Barbies as compliant girlfriends. They also plan to enshrine their new patriarchy in the Barbieland constitution the next day. Barbie tries to persuade Ken to change it back, but he refuses as he finally feels worthy for the first time. Barbie sinks into a depression before Gloria gives a speech on being a woman, inspiring Barbie to save Barbieland.Barbie, Gloria, Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan (who is against the Kens' new rule) and other discontinued Barbies and Kens hatch a plan. Using Gloria's speech, they free the Barbies of their subjugation before turning the Kens against each other to distract them from changing the constitution. As the Kens fight on the beach, the Barbies restore Barbieland's matriarchy back into the constitution.A distraught Ken expresses disappointment in being nothing other than an accessory to Barbie, to which she encourages him to be his own person. The two apologize to each other for their mistakes. President Barbie (Issa Rae) makes a friendly deal with the Mattel CEO before agreeing to equality for the Kens and other discontinued toys. Barbie, still unsure of who she is, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), Mattel's co-founder and her creator. Ruth states that Barbie doesn't have a specific purpose, as her evolution will always exceed her roots. She shows Barbie visions of motherhood, encouraging her to choose her own path.Barbie decides to live in the real world as a human, going by the name Barbara Handler. Gloria and Sasha drive her to an appointment, where Barbie proudly declares she is there to see her gynecologist.</p>

                            <p>Description: Berlin-Gropiusstadt in the hot summer of 2003, in the time of tough social reforms. The teenagers Lukas, Julius and Gino spend their time in the Berlin district of Neukölln smoking pot and trying, largely unsuccessfully, to pick up girls. With the half-Cuban Sanchez, a new student joins the class, who quickly makes friends with Lukas and his buddies.At home, the teenagers usually have nothing but troubles. Lukas perhaps has the greatest potential to make something of himself and is praised by his teacher for his well-written essays. He is full of admiration for his well-trained older brother Marco, who is a living street legend in the district and keeps his head above water as a petty criminal. Luke's father Matthias is unemployed and overwhelmed with parenting after the death of his wife. Gino suffers greatly from his father, a violent and choleric alcoholic who terrorizes his mother and son. Julius lives without parents in a run-down apartment together with his older brother, who is always drunk or stoned, bumming around with his buddies during the day. The loudmouthed Julius is always up for the party and drugs, and sometimes takes his brother's gun with him. Sanchez lives with his single mother, who can barely make ends meet financially even with a job, and despite everything wants to be a good mother to her son.One morning, Lukas cannot enter his school because his student ID is lost and the security guards at the school gate are not allowed to let him pass without it. He meets up with his already school cutting friends. When the boys want to buy a small amount of weed in the nearby park, they get caught in the rivalty of two groups of dealers. A mass brawl breaks out until the police arrive. Not only gets Lukas beaten up, but one of the drug dealer gangs now demands 500 euros from him as compensation for the police intervention on his turf. On top of that, the boys are annoyed not to have enough money for activities like the public swimming pool, parties or going out with girls. To solve their money problems, Sanchez comes up with an idea. They break into their school at night and steal some of the brand new student computers, that were financed by the state of Berlin. Despite unprofessional execution, the boys succeed in breaking in; the next day, however, the school is full of police officers and journalists, and the theft at the "troubled school" attracts widespread media attention.The boys manage to sell three of the computers for a disappointing sum. For the 800 euros they receive, they buy new brand-name clothes, among other things. When his teacher asks him for a personal interview, Lukas initially believes they have been busted - but Mr. Sonnabend suspects the fellow students with an immigrant background instead and believes that Lukas, as a German student, could help him solve the case. The drug dealers still haven't received the 500 euros and demolish Lukas' father's car as punishment. Lukas tries to clarify the situation with the leader of the drug dealers, who wants to beat him up. The drug dealer's muslim Mothers and aunts observe the situation and convice the dealer to make peace with Lukas. Later, when Lukas is standing in front of the door with the dealer without his family, he also has to give him his newly bought sneakers to make peace.In the meantime, Lukas has admitted to his older brother Marco that he and his friends have stolen the computers. Marco arranges a meeting with a guy to whom the boys can sell the remaining computers. But the man doesn't pay them and simply drives away with the computers. What the guys don't know is that the guy is an accomplice of Marco's, who is now making money off the stolen computers for himself and using the money to pay off his own debts in the underworld. It is briefly seen that Marco uses his brother's lost student ID from the opening scene of the film to roll cigarettes.While Luke, Julius and Sanchez get rid of the last computers, Gino, who is becoming increasingly desperate about the situation with his brutal father, goes crazy. Gino takes a drug given to him by Julius and gains courage from the intoxication, hits his father, who is once again beating up on his mother, with a bottle and seriously injures him. Then he jumps out of the window himself. When Lukas, Julius and Sanchez hear this and want to go to the hospital, Julius discovers his girlfriend Denise making out with the drug dealer Cem. A brief fight with Cem ensues, but the boys realize that going to the hospital is more important to them. The film ends with them visiting the badly injured but responsive Gino and hugging him as a sign of their friendship.</p>

                            <p>Description: An unflinching deep dive into how a wide-eyed kid from Ohio morphed from Internet sensation to most polarizing man in sports. For every high-profile critic (UFC president Dana White), there's another supporter in his corner (former professional boxer Mike Tyson). In 2013, Jake and his older brother, Logan, lit up social media with pranks and antics posted first to Vine and then a YouTube channel that racked up millions of views. The brothers parlayed their online success into lucrative side hustles, with Jake releasing music and landing a role on a Disney Channel show (Bizaardvark). As their notoriety grew, so did tensions between the once-close siblings. When Jake's real-life controversies nearly ruined his career, he got a second chance as a boxer who shocked skeptics as he knocked out one opponent after another. Built on gripping interviews with the Paul brothers along with their parents, fans, fellow boxers, and the skeptical old guard the film culminates with a nail-biting match that will prove if Jake has what it takes to rule his new kingdom.</p>

There's just one tantalising dream for the women of Ballygar to taste freedom and escape the gauntlet of domestic life: to win a pilgrimage to the sacred French town of Lourdes. And with a little benevolent interference from their cheeky and rebellious priest, close friends Lily, Eileen, Dolly and Sheila are the 'lucky' few to win this ticket of a lifetime at their riotous local raffle night.—TMDB</p>

When Veda (Mrunal Thakur) and Arjun's (Angad Bedi) families meet to discuss their marriage, the conversation revolves around their shared interests and hobbies. Both sets of parents seem to agree that the couple would make a 'perfect match', as they share many hobbies and common interests. Veda's grandmother, who is religious and widowed, walks into the room, and casually inquires if the couple have had sex yet. The other elders are shocked, and Arjun and Veda are left embarrassed.
Veda's grandmother Kamli (Neena Gupta) insists on the importance of physical intimacy in a relationship, as she believes hobbies can be abandoned and interests change over time. Later that night, she privately narrates to Veda her relationship with her own husband, Veda's grandfather, which was based on mutual attraction for each other, as well as the ability to satisfy the other in bed.
Taking cues from this, Veda and Arjun become intimate, often renting private hotel rooms to engage in intercourse. Veda confesses to her grandmother that, though she enjoys the experience, she isn't left feeling fully satisfied. Meanwhile, Veda's parents Mohini (Kanupriya Pandit) & Mohan (Hemant Kher) are chided by Veda's grandmother for having let the spark die out of their own relationship, and forcing the same on to their daughter.
One afternoon, Veda and Arjun visit her grandmother, and excitedly proclaim that they have finally understood how to satisfy the other person in bed. Veda's grandmother is pleased to hear this, and with an open heart offers her blessings for their wedding. She even offers to set up her room for them, to use on their wedding night as a honeymoon suite.The Mirror
Ishita (Tillotama Shome) is a graphic designer, in her early 40s, who lives alone. She suffers from frequent migraines. Her maid, Seema (Amruta Subhash), visits during the day, to clean her apartment. One afternoon, Ishita walks in on Seema having sex with Seema's husband, Kamal (Shrikant Yadav), in her bedroom. Too shocked to confront them, Ishita hides while the couple finish and leave.
Ishita realizes this is a daily occurrence but is unable to stop it. She also realizes being turned on by watching them have sex. The next day, she secretly starts hiding in her apartment, to spy on them through a mirror and leaves her office daily around 3 pm on the pretense of seeing an acupuncturist for her migraines.
One day, Seema spots Ishita in the same mirror and realizes she is being watched. Unable to confront Ishita lest she be fired, but also excited by having someone watch her, she continues and pretends as if nothing has happened.
One afternoon, Ishita accidentally knocks something over, causing a commotion and forcing Seema to confront her. The two hurl accusations at each other and Seema is fired. She struggles to land another job, while Ishita cannot find another maid as rumors about the altercation have spread.
At night, Kamal and Seema argue with each other outside their tiny one-room apartment, right where she found and yelled at her daughter for conversing with her boyfriend. Kamal is at first angry with Seema for screaming at her for something trivial in public at odd hours of the night, which then evolved into an argument about her willingly allowing an invasion of their privacy by Ishita but reconciles when he realizes she did so intentionally as a turn on.
Some weeks later, Ishita and Seema run into each other while buying groceries. They inquire about the other's well-being, and Seema asks if she can come back to work. Ishita agrees, and hands over the keys to her apartment. The next day, Ishita sneaks back into her apartment at 3pm, indicating a return to the old patterns.Sex with the Ex
Vijay (Vijay Varma ) a successful CEO of a company, who is married but has a strained relationship with his wife Anita (Mukti Mohan), meets with an accident while driving his old car. Before the accident, he had a video call with his girlfriend Nisha (Jeniffer Piccinato), who distracted him and caused him to crash into a tree while trying to avoid hitting a cyclist. Unable to start his car or use his phone, he seeks help from the cyclist and they go to a nearby village. He asks a reluctant mechanic to fix his car, but there is no phone signal available.
He goes to a coffee shop and hears a familiar song playing nearby. He follows the sound and finds a woman Shanti (Tamannaah Bhatia) in a red Saree dancing at a community hall. He tries to approach her, but she denies being the person he thinks she is and asks him to leave. A police officer arrives and addresses her by the name he called her, which makes him happy.Inside her house, it is revealed that they were once married, but she disappeared ten years ago. He is thrilled to see her again, but she wants him to leave. They recall their past and have conversations, during which he behaves inappropriately towards her. She repeatedly asks him to go away, but he refuses. They discuss the events leading up to her disappearance, and she suspects that their friend Anu was involved.
Vijay reveals that he married Anu and had children with her, becoming the CEO of Anu's father's company. This angers Shanti, who thinks Anu orchestrated her abduction to marry Vijay. They have sex, and while lying together, Shanti mentions the pregnancy test she took before her disappearance. Vijay's response reveals that he manipulated the situation with Anu and planned everything to marry Anu. Anu had seen the result of the pregnancy test in Shanti's bathroom as she was there for a festival. Vijay knew the brand of the test kit Shanti used, even though Shanti never revealed it to him.
Shanti realizes this and confronts him, and he proceeds to suffocating Shanti and killing her with a pillow. In order to escape the arriving policeman, Vijay escapes through a window. Back at his car, he sees people pulling his body out, thinking he is dead because he didn't respond. Shanti appears next to him and tells him he should have returned when he had the chance to which he screams.Tilchatta
Suraj Singh (Kumud Mishra) is a wealthy former king in rural Rajasthan, who lives in a palace with his wife and step-son Ankur (Zeeshan Nadaf). He is sexually abusive towards, not just his wife, Devyani (Kajol), but also to young girls in the village. He had married Devyani after lusting for her in a prostitution house, and took in her son too.
After he assaults a maid working at the palace, forcing her to quit, Devyani is tasked with a replacement. On a regular weekly call, Devyani's mother, who runs a prostitution house, tells Devyani of a young prostitute contracting "the disease" (HIV) through a client. Devyani's mother feels bad for the girl, as her life is ruined at a young age.Meanwhile, Devyani is preparing her 20-year-old son, Ankur, to move to United Kingdom for higher education. Ankur is reluctant to leave his mother alone with his stepfather, but Devyani's long-term plan is to follow Ankur abroad once he settles down. Suraj discourages Ankur in his plans, and also keeps chiding him for his unknown father.
Suraj sets his eyes on Rekha (Anushka Kaushik), the new maid hired by Devyani to replace the one who quit. Rekha, is young and innocent, and Suraj tries to take advantage of her on the pretext of getting a massage. Ankur walks in at the same time, and Suraj is forced to leave. Meanwhile, Ankur notices Rekha's disheveled appearance as she adjusts her clothing.At night, Devyani is awoken by sounds of pleasure and moaning emanating from a room in the castle. She believes it is Suraj and Rekha, and seems oddly pleased. Unknown to Suraj, Rekha is the former prostitute, hired from Devyani's mother, to work in the castle. Devyani installs her, hoping that she will pass the "disease" on to Suraj once he inevitably assaults her. As Devyani walks towards the room to seek confirmation, she is interrupted by the sound of Suraj stumbling into the house. He is drunk and unable to walk, and passes out in the courtyard. Devyani is shocked, and turns with a look of horror at the sounds still emanating from the room. She realizes her plan has horribly backfired, as Rekha is likely having sex with Ankur.</p>

                            <p>Description: Marco, Tato, Serena and Leo are nine years old, and they are inseparable friends, ready to defend each other from their schoolmates' bullying. All four of them feel neglected by their families: Marco's parents forget his birthday, then pick the wrong cake and present, humiliate him for the unresolved matter of wetting the bed and force him to look after his younger sister. Tato lives with his single mother, who is constantly looking for the love of her life. Serena can't stand her father pressuring her to become the next tennis champion instead of the next champion of snack-eating. And then there's Leo, loved by his grandparents, who give him a brilliant education instead of Leo's parents, who went missing in India. On the evening of Marco's birthday, all four find themselves together to blow out the candles and unknowingly make the same wish: become adults. In one night's time, they find themselves magically the same age as their parents, but with the same behaviour and thoughts they have as kids. From now on, funny adventures and unexpected events make them cope with everyday life, such as finding a place to live and a job. Marco will succeed in conquering the woman of his dreams, the irresistible teacher Francesca... But is everything as they had imagined it? Only time can give them the answers they are looking for.</p>

                            <p>Description: Before 9/11 and Lockerbie, one brutal attack shook the world and inspired a new era of global terrorism. The hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi in 1986 is a story of terror and tragedy, but also a story of bravery and survival - one which could have been incalculably worse were it not for the actions of a group of rookie flight attendants and a Pan Am employee on the ground who risked his life negotiating with the hijackers. Set in a gripping geopolitical landscape, this feature length documentary plays like a thriller, with first-hand testimony from passengers, the flight crew and negotiators, accompanied by dramatic reconstruction.—Blast Films</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2022 a new mastermind entered the arena to craft the tests for the Fittest on Earth. Longtime CrossFit Games Head Judge and Seminar Staff Flowmaster Adrian Bozman's approach to programming the CrossFit Games brought the sport's top athletes back to the basics while challenging them to develop new skills. Tia-Clair Toomey vied for an unprecedented sixth title while rumors of retirement swirled and Mal O'Brien continued to rise. Meanwhile, 2021 Fittest Man on Earth Justin Medeiros worked to defend his title against determined competitors such as Roman Khrennikov - a multiyear qualifier who had yet to step onto the Games competition floor - and Ricky Garard, newly returned from a four-year ban for violating CrossFit's drug policy. In "Fittest on Earth: Retro/Active," watch as athletes face familiar movements with new twists, some thriving and others learning the hard way to begin anew with the basics, this time paying more attention.</p>

                            <p>Description: Owen Browning (Adam DeVine) is a young bank manager about to marry Parker McDermott (Nina Dobrev), whose estranged parents contact her to come to the wedding. He's excited he's finally going to meet them, as she's concerned they can be a bit much.Owen's parents Neil (Richard Kind) and Margie (Julie Hagerty) are difficult. Owen calls to tell them the good news about Parker's parents attending the wedding. He first has to hear about an odd nickel allergy of a guest, then they show their ignorance of Parker's profession as a yoga instructor, believing it involves a stripper pole. Rather than being happy about the news that the other in-laws are coming, they criticize them for being absent in Parker's life.At the bank, Owen has to free an employee who's been played upon by being locked in the vault. So, he shows and talks about how state-of-the-art their bank's security system is. They point out their rival bank's vault security is considered the best in the state. Owen also points out all vaults have an emergency escape latch.Out at dinner with his parents, they talk about the soon appearance of Parker's parents. Meanwhile, Owen talks with the storage space facility where Parker's parents rent a locker as he's hoping to access photos of the Parkers for a wedding photo montage. His call inadvertently alerts the crime boss Rehan (Poorna Jagannathan) to their return, when the storage space manager tells Rehan about Owen inquiring about the McDermott's locker.The following night, the McDermotts let themselves into their home while Parker is still out leading a yoga class and scare Owen. They insist he calls them Billy (Pierce Brosnan) and Lilly (Ellen Barkin). Owen and Parker tell Billy and Lilly that they met at Parker's yoga class due to Owen's hip issues. He went to her class for a year and a half before Parker finally asked him out.
The next day, Owen takes off work to spend the day with the in-laws. They pick the agenda, so they go skydiving, get tattoos, and drink. The McDermotts are adventure freaks while Owen is a totally laid back, peace loving, normal guy.The next day, an infamous full-costumed pair of criminals called the "Ghost Bandits" hold up the bank. As the robbery occurs during his wedding week, specific indicators such as the male's cologne, flashbacks to the bar, and what he told Lilly the previous day lead Owen to believe that the robbers might be his future in-laws. Owen had told Lilly about all the codes and the security measures to break into the vault.
Unknown to Owen, Rehan had met Billy at the bar the previous night. Billy had told Owen that he knows nothing.FBI special agent Roger Oldham (Michael Rooker) questions Owen as the bank manager with his in-laws behind him. Not able to say anything, Parker insists they leave once he breaks out in tears. Oldham has dedicated most of his career chasing the Ghost Bandits and he's convinced they are behind the robbery.
Owen know that if the McDermotts robbed the bank, then he did too, as he told Lilly the codes.Trying to enlist his parents' help in outing the McDermotts, Owen tells them his suspicions. They do ask direct inappropriate questions at dinner, but Billy and Lilly expertly redirect the conversation. Parker later asks Owen, but she thinks his theory is crazy.The next day, Owen follows his in-laws to Rehan's and hears her threaten to kill Parker if they don't get her $5,000,000 more before the wedding. Billy had just paid Rehan $ 1 million, as that was the amount that Billy and Lilly stole from her. But Rehan wants the $ 5 million as penalties and interest. She gives them till end of the week to come up with the cash.
Oldham stops Owen on the highway, finds planted evidence in the trunk (burner phones, voice modulators which makes it look like Owen robbed his own bank), and spills it on his in-laws. Oldham puts a wire on him, hoping to get the McDermotts to confess. Instead, Rehan shows up with her henchmen and takes Parker hostage as insurance. Disgusted, Owen joins forces with his in-laws.
McDermotts say that Rehan was their partner. She would choose the banks. But she started losing it and they were afraid that they would find out about Parker. So, at the last heist, they took the money and ran.
Owen says that he knows everything about banks and can help them rob $ 5 million in 2 days.They first choose Victory Union Bank to rob as the bank manager is lazy. However, they lose most of the cash through a comedy of errors. They are able to steal the money from the armored car which was taking the cash from the bank, but the security kicks in and due to Owen's ineptitude, their getaway car is disabled. Owen eventually gets into the armored car, and rescues Billy and Lilly. But the cash was in their getaway car. They are pursued by the police, but Owen drives through a cemetery. The armored car smashes through the headstones, but the cop cars are not able to.So, then they focus on Atlas Reserve. Owen goes in, asking it's manager Phoebe King (Lauren Lapkus) how he can better equip his bank. Phoebe is the best bank manager in the business and every inch of her bank is triple secured. Phoebe's arrogance kicks in, so she shows him all of the safeguards with him. Just as the safe open, the McDermotts create a diversion out front while Owen locks himself in and then uses the emergency escape latch to escape with the money.At the ransom drop, Rehan is pleasantly surprised that Owen brought the money, but will kill them anyway. He miraculously guns them down as the McDermotts distract the cops so Owen can sneak back into the vault with the money.As the McDermotts turn themselves in and help Oldham with his ex, he lets them go briefly to Owen and Parker's wedding reception.
During the credits, Owen slips a paperclip into a piece of cake for his new in-laws to use to get free of their handcuffs.</p>

                            <p>Description: In a retro-futuristic version of the 1950s, a television host introduces a live production of Asteroid City, a play in the film's setting by famed playwright Conrad Earp. In the play, a youth astronomy convention is held in the fictional desert town of Asteroid City. The play's events are depicted in widescreen and stylized color, while the television special is seen in black-and-white Academy ratio.In the play, war photojournalist Augie Steenbeck arrives early to the Junior Stargazer convention with Woodrow, his intellectual teenage son, and his three younger daughters. When their car breaks down, Augie phones his father-in-law, Stanley, asking his help. Stanley, who dislikes his son-in-law, persuades him to tell the children about their mother's recent death, which Augie had concealed. Augie and Woodrow meet Midge Campbell, a famous but world-weary actress, and her daughter Dinah, who, like Woodrow, will be honored at the convention. Augie and Midge, and Woodrow and Dinah, gradually fall in love throughout the play. The other convention participants arrive: five-star General Grif Gibson, astronomer Dr. Hickenlooper, three additional teenaged honorees (Ricky, Clifford, and Shelly) and their parents (J.J., Roger, and Sandy), a busload of elementary-school children chaperoned by young teacher June Douglas, and a cowboy band led by singer Montana. A local motel provides everyone's accommodations.Gibson welcomes the attendees at the Asteroid City crater where the teenagers are to receive awards for various inventions. A UFO suddenly appears above the crater; an alien emerges and steals a fragment of the meteorite that created the crater. Augie photographs the alien. General Gibson with instructions from the president, places the town under military quarantine, and everyone is subjected to medical and psychiatric examinations. Meanwhile, a romance blossoms between Montana and June, who assure the students that the alien is likely peaceful. The Stargazer honorees use Dr. Hickenlooper's equipment to attempt to contact the alien. Using a guarded pay phone, Ricky calls his school newspaper to relay the quarantine details and cover-up to the outside world.The Asteroid City events become national news. A furious General Gibson is about to end the quarantine when the UFO reappears and the alien returns the meteorite fragment. When Gibson reinstates the quarantine, the children, scientists, and parents revolt, using the honorees' inventions to overpower the military.The play's creation is interspersed between the play. Some time after Conrad Earp started writing, he meets with actor Jones Hall, who performs an audition in Earp's home and is immediately cast. During the same interaction, Earp and Hall kiss, establishing their relationship as lovers. Earp writes the play with help from a local acting school and recruits most cast members from it, including Mercedes Ford, a temperamental yet talented actress who plays Midge.During the recorded performance of the play, Hall, who plays Augie, confronts the play's director Schubert Green, saying he "still doesn't understand the play", and asks Green if he is "doing him right". Green tells Hall to keep playing Augie the same way despite being uncertain, and that he is doing him right. After that interaction, while taking a smoke break on a balcony, Hall runs into the actress who was cast to play Augie's wife before her only scene was cut. She recites the deleted scene's text to him.Six months into the play's run, Conrad Earp dies in an automobile accident. In the play's epilogue, Augie and his family are the last to leave Asteroid City after General Gibson lifts the quarantine. Augie's daughters bury their mother's ashes in the desert, Woodrow wins the fellowship funding, and Midge leaves Augie her mailing address. Augie and his family quietly drive away.</p>

                            <p>Description: Ariel is a mermaid princess and the youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of the merpeople. She is fascinated with the human world despite never having seen it, as Triton forbid all merfolk from going to the surface after Ariel's mother was killed by a human. Ariel collects human objects with the support of her best friend, Flounder, a sergeant major, and Scuttle, a Northern gannet.
Ariel misses the Coral Moon meeting that she was supposed to attend with her sisters, and is scolded by Triton. Afterward, she sees fireworks above the ocean and surfaces to see it up close. The fireworks come from the ship of Prince Eric, a prince of a nearby island kingdom. Ariel overhears Eric telling the Prime Minister, Grimsby, about his wish to explore the unknown and help the people of his kingdom. A storm arrives and the ship crashes against the rocks, forcing all to go for the lifeboats. Ariel rescues Eric and brings him to shore, where she sings with her siren voice to help save his life. She flees before he can regain full consciousness. After Eric recovers, his mother Queen Selina forbids him from sailing again.Ariel's absent-minded behavior is commented on by her sisters. Overhearing this, Triton questions Sebastian and learns how she saved a human's life. Triton travels to Ariel's grotto to confront her; when she refuses to swear to never go to the surface again, Triton destroys her collection of human objects. After Triton leaves, Ariel is approached by a pair of moray eels with electrical powers who show her an image of sea witch Ursula, Triton's sister and Ariel's aunt, who offers to help Ariel.Ariel follows the eels to Ursula's lair, where she presents a deal: she will transform Ariel into a human for three days, during which Ariel must receive a "true love's kiss" from Eric to remain human permanently. If she fails, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. To become human, Ariel must give up her tail, the ability to breathe underwater, and her siren voice, the last of which Ursula will keep in a nautilus shell she wears on her neck. Ariel accepts and is given human legs. She is taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian, and is rescued by a fisherman, who takes her to the island kingdom and to Eric's castle. Eric, who has been frantically searching for the woman who saved his life, rushes to meet Ariel when he hears of her arrival. Ariel is excited, but her lack of voice has Eric immediately turning away. Later that evening, Ariel explores the castle and finds Eric's collection of items he'd accumulated over his travels. Eric and Ariel spend time together poring over his collection.The next day, Eric takes Ariel around the kingdom. Sebastian, who has followed Ariel on land, realizes that Ursula has put a cheat in the spell, causing Ariel to forget that she needs to kiss Eric. Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder take it upon themselves to get the pair to kiss. They are almost successful, but are thwarted by Ursula's eels. Ursula is enraged by the close call, and transforms herself into the guise of Vanessa, a beautiful young woman, and uses Ariel's siren voice to hypnotize Eric.The next morning, Ariel and her friends discover that Eric will be announcing his engagement to Vanessa later that day. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who rushes to the engagement party and confronts Ursula to break the nautilus shell around her neck. Ariel's voice is restored to her and the enchantment on Eric is broken. But before they can kiss, the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid and Vanessa resumes her true form as Ursula.Ursula grabs Ariel and dives back into the ocean, where they are confront by Triton. The deal that Ariel made is unbreakable, so Triton trades himself for Ariel, and he is turned to dust by Ursula's eels. Ursula claims Triton's trident just as Eric arrives to help; in the melee, Ursula accidentally kills her eels. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size and summons a storm to threaten Ariel and Eric. In this storm, Ariel pulls herself onto a surfaced ship and turns the helm at the right moment to impale Ursula with its splintered bowsprit. Once Ursula is killed, Triton comes back to life; he and Ariel recognize the other's sacrifice for them. Eric manages to return home, where Selina acknowledges that Eric's love for Ariel was real.Triton eventually accepts that although Ariel has returned home as he wanted, she is unhappy. At Sebastian's urging, Triton transforms Ariel into a human permanently, and she reunites with Eric. The pair decide to travel together, with the blessing of both their parents, and with the support of people of both their worlds.</p>

                            <p>Description: Valmiki (Paresh Rawal) and Randeep (Ronit Roy) start their career as clerks in the company of Aditya Jindal (Sachin Khedekar). Randeep, who marries Jindal's daughter Yashoda "Yashu" (Manisha Koirala), becomes wealthy while Valmiki remains poor. On the day of the birth of both their children, Randeep's son appears to be dead. When nurse Sulochana informs Valmiki about this, he pities Randeep and Yashu and offers to exchange his baby with the dead one. He says everything he has in life is due to the Jindal family and is happy to make this sacrifice.After switching them, however, the apparently dead child begins to cry. Sulochana tries to switch them back, but Valmiki, sensing an opportunity that his son would have a better life growing up in a rich family, prevents her from switching, pushing her accidentally off a ledge. Valmiki was angry at Randeep marrying into the Jindal family and going from an measly employee to a co-owner in an instant, while Valmiki stayed poor.
Sulochana goes into a coma, while Valmiki gets a leg cramp that makes him limp permanently. The two boys grow-up in different ways. Raj (Ankur Rathee), raised at Jindal's house, is timid, innocent, and soft-spoken, while Bantu (Kartik Aaryan), who is raised at Valmiki's house, is smart, truthful, outspoken, and hard-working. Valmiki, who favors Raj (who is Valmiki's own son), treats Bantu with disgust due to his true parentage.
Raj scores 9/100 in maths, but Valmiki makes it 97/100 before showing the report-card to Yashu. Bantu scores 98/100 and Valmiki yells at him for losing 2 marks. Nisha (Debattama Saha) is Bantu's sister. With time, Bantu's mother passes away.After his MBA was denied by Valmiki, Bantu heads to an interview for a job at a law firm headed by a young woman named Samara (Kriti Sanon). Samara initially rejects him for the job (Bantu is from Govt Law College in Amritsar, while all other applicants are from Harvard or Cambridge) but is later impressed by his knowledge and quick-wittiness (Samara asks Bantu to prove himself by getting alimony for the wife in a divorce case. Instead Bantu figures out their issues and gets them to reconcile instead. He makes the husband realize the his wife wants to work and be independent.. while the wife only wants to start a family) and hires him. Bantu starts to develop romantic feelings for Samara.
Meanwhile, Raj returns from abroad, having finally completing his MBA after multiple failed attempts. He has completed a 4 yr course in 7 yrs.Jindal sends Raj to reject Sarang (Sunny Hinduja), a wealthy, powerful and influential man who offers to buy 50% of their company's shares. Sarang had a business of exporting toys and used Jindal's cargo planes for the same. One day, during a raid, it is exposed that Sarang was doing drugs trade stuffed in his toys. Jindal stopped the business and now Sarang is sending his brother to restart the agreement.
Randeep watches the deal from a restaurant where Samara has a meeting with Kakkar, who attempts to bribe her to move a case in his brother's favor (Samara had evidence that Kakkar's brother had assaulted a woman). When Samara refuses and he keeps on insisting, Bantu interferes and supports Samara in the matter. Randeep is disappointed by Raj's hesitance and inability to say no to Sarang's brother Vikrant, but is proud of Bantu and Samara for saying no to Kakkar. Following this, Raj is engaged with Samara on Jindal's suggestion, but Samara has fallen in love with Bantu.
Meanwhile Valmiki knows that Randeep has kept Sulochana alive on respirator and pays for her medical bills, as she delivered his baby.When Samara reveals her feelings for Bantu, he convinces her to ask Randeep to call-off her marriage with Raj. Sarang attempts to kill Randeep (by stabbing Randeep in the chest with an umbrella) for refusing to sell the shares moments before Samara and Bantu arrive to call off the marriage. Bantu saves Randeep by taking him to the hospital despite several attempts by Sarang's men to stop them (they block the building's elevator, lock all the emergency exit doors to the staircase.. Bantu takes Randeep down in the window cleaning lift outside the building).
There he meets Sulochana (who had seen Bantu bring Randeep into the hospital and finds that he is Valmiki's son), who comes out of her coma and reveals Bantu's true parentage. Sulochana wants to reveal the truth to Randeep, but dies shortly thereafter.
The furious Bantu slaps Valmiki, telling him that he learned the secret about his birth. Bantu then manages to enter Randeep's house (when the doctor recommends that Randeep needs positivity around him, and asks for the man who brought him to the hospital.. Turns out Bantu had threatened the doctor's kid to say this in front of the family). Jindal is fond of Bantu for saving Randeep. Jindal offers Bantu a salary of Rs 50,000 pm.Bantu begins to address the issues plaguing the house by patching up Randeep's broken relationship with Yashu (which was fragile, as Randeep had an affair once with a woman 7 years ago), settling the dispute with Sarang, and reforming the corrupt family members Kailash (Ashwin Mushran) and Arun (Ali Asgar), who are sons of Jindal. Kailash had increased the hospital bill from Rs 1.2 lakhs to 10 lakhs by giving 5% commission to the billing person and keeping the rest for himself. Bantu had seen this. Bantu exposes them to Jindal, who takes away all financial powers away from them.
Bantu wants to help bury the hatchet with Sarang and takes Jindal to meet his brother Vikrant. But Vikrant's men attack Jindal, so Bantu cleans them up. On their way out, they run into Sarang as well, and it is clear that Sarang is in no mood for peace.Bantu and Samara also tell the truth to Raj about their relationship and Raj calls of his marriage with Samara, also making his parents realize that he is an adult and should be allowed to take his own decisions regarding his life and career.
At a party thrown at their house, Sarang uses the situation to his advantage by kidnapping and threatening to kill Yashu unless Randeep gives away shares worth Rs 500 crores to him in addition to letting Sarang use Jindal cargo planes for smuggling drugs.Bantu thrashes Sarang (he gets Sarang to kill his own brother Vikrant, with the umbrella) and his goons and saves Yashu. Bantu and Valmiki arrive at Jindal's house, where Jindal slaps Valmiki and reveals that he overheard the conversation between Sulochana and Bantu right before her death. This is why Jindal got Bantu home.
Bantu unites with his biological father, Randeep but asks him not to reveal the truth to Yashu, fearing she might be disheartened to know that Raj is not her real child. Unaware of this, Yasuh remarks that Bantu is equal to Raj as he saved her and the family, thereby giving Bantu 50% of its shares. Yashu then asks Valmiki to train Raj for five years to be as competent as Bantu and become the CEO of the company. Bantu also forgives Valmiki and mends his relationship with him.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1979 Rudravanam, Venkata Chalapathy and his wife are brutally assaulted, whisked away and immolated by the outraged inhabitants, who surmise that their eerie rituals (Black magic) induced multiple deaths in the village; the dying woman curses Rudravanam and anticipates destruction of the village after twelve years. The couple's young son Bhairava is subsequently admitted into an orphanage at the Sarpanch Harishchandra Prasad's behest.In 1991, a week after the disappearance of a resident Siddhaiah in the aftermath of a supernatural crow mauling him, Anasuyamma, escorted by her son Surya and nephew, visits Rudravanam, her hometown, to contribute a tract of their land for construction of a school and attend the village's annual carnival, organized in the honor of Goddess Modamamba. Surya's encounter with Nandini, Harishchandra Prasad's daughter, results in love and she apparently reciprocates but hesitates to accept his proposal. Siddhaiah, who has developed a sinister pox, shows up at the temple and dies in the inner sanctum, which is deemed to be a sacrilege. The temple's head priest analyzes the customary edict, declaring that the Goddess and her children (the villagers) are desecrated and to contain the debacle with Siddhaiah's death, it is necessary to seal the village in eight directions for the next eight days; commuting is prohibited and all the religious emblems are supposed to be stored in the temple. Surya and his family are permitted to exit, considering the fact that they have not been to the village for eighteen years. Nevertheless, Surya reenters Rudravanam to deliver a vial that could cure Nandini, who is prone to convulsions, rendering him incapable of traversing the extremities of the place for eight days.Sudha, Nandini's close friend, transgresses the boundary to elope with her lover Kumar, whose tragic death she witnesses and returns to the village, walks into a beehive, provoking the bees to attack and kill her. Unaware of Sudha's quietus, her parents conceal her elopement, dreading disgrace. Alleged suicides of Suri, a milkman, and Parvathi, Surya's cousin, intrigue Surya, who distrusts the assumptions and investigates the killings with an RMP doctor. An Aghora cautions the village of forthcoming perils and comprehends that they've made a mistake by imposing the lock down. Surya discovers Sudha's corpse and detects Kumar's demise; realizing that Suri witnessed Sudha's death and Parvathi saw Suri slitting his throat just as Sudha viewed Kumar's death, Surya deduces that death is being infected from one to another and locates the latest possible victim: Nandini, who eventually contemplates suicide but Surya's timely intervention rescues her. Surya assimilates the past involving Chalapathy and his family and infiltrates their dilapidated residence with the RMP; discerning a recent visit to the place, Surya suspects Bhairava. The head priest assesses the edict and proclaims that sacrificing Nandini will end the occurrences. Resisting the villagers, Surya sedates Nandini and vows to resolve the problem within eight hours. He visits Bhairava's orphanage, where he discovers that Bhairava absconded after paralyzing its founder. Surya locates a few Aghoras in the process of spearheading a search for Bhairava's hideout. The Aghora, who has warned the villagers earlier, assists him in discovering a cave, where the spell has been cast. Surya uncovers Bhairava's belongings, which help him realize that Kumar is Bhairava, and the actual edict of Rudravanam, which was replaced with a fake one: one that is being utilized currently. Grasping that a villager has been aiding and in fact, directing Kumar to execute the curse, Surya ascertains that Nandini's sacrifice is a hoax to exterminate the village.With the Aghora, Surya departs to desist the villagers but the superstitious residents of neighboring villages prevent them, fearing deaths in their respective hometowns. He eventually manages to return and is stunned to see the villagers possessed, since they have proceeded with the ritual, owing to Surya's retardation. Conjecturing that Harishchandra Prasad is Kumar's secret accomplice, Surya goes to confront him and realizes that Nandini is Chalapathi's daughter, whose existence has been secreted by Harischandra Prasad. Perceiving Nandini to be the principal perpetrator, Surya informs Harishchandra Prasad of Nandini's conspiracies and rushes back to the site of sacrifice. He confronts Nandini for decimating the innocents but she refuses to back off, commands him to leave and tries to proceed with the ritual. She tells him that Chalapathy was an Atharvana Veda practitioner, whose attempts to cure his paralyzed wife were misinterpreted to be evil practices in a frenzy and that she has been exacting revenge from the village along with Bhairava. Despite Nandini's insistence, Surya refuses to leave and attempts to aid her in realizing her love for him, requesting her to cease the ritual. Nandini, who is incompetent to attack him due to the pendant, reciprocates his feelings and asks him to kill her, which will intercept the ritual. He brings himself to stab her, ending the death plague and rescuing the villagers from getting killed.During Nandini's cremation, Surya requests the villagers to retire from their taboo regarding evil practices and transform Chalapathy's house into a school. He looks at Nandini's pendant, prompting his eyes to glow in a paranormal way.</p>

                            <p>Description: Bhamragad, Maharashtra, 2003. Lakshmi Sharma (Konkona Sen Sharma) is a Naxal captured by the police and is under custody of Inspector Viswapal Suri (Kumud Mishra).
Lakshmi is brutally sexually assaulted by Viswapal's superior officer (Jagbir Singh Pannu) under orders from the local politician (Anurag Kashyap). Viswapal had protested this brutality but was told to step aside.The Naxals led by Shankar (Vijay Kumar Singh) attack the police station and rescue Lakshmi. Lakshmi kills the politician and the inspector but leaves Viswapal alive and asks him to fight the system.Chapter 1:
13 years later Viswapal is the subordinate to Guffu (Arjun Kapoor). Narayan Khote (Naseeruddin Shah) is a local drug don. He confronts Guffu for working for Surti (Jay Upadhyay) as his courier and smuggling cheap coke from Nairobi into India. Guffu is paid Rs 3 Lakhs per month for his services.
Narayan agrees to spare Guffu only if he kills Surti. Guffu and Viswapal attack Surti's rave party and kill him and his suppliers from Nairobi.
Guffu wants to take the drugs worth Rs 2 Crores with him, but Viswapal advises against it as they are already getting paid Rs 2 Crores from Narayan for the hit on Surti. Guffu doesn't know how to swim.While escaping Surti's mansion, Guffu and Viswapal are arrested by IPS Officer Rajiv Mishra (Aasmaan Bhardwaj) for possession of drugs in their car. Rajiv tells Guffu that Surti survived even after taking 4 bullets. So, Rajiv knows that Guffu took a contract to kill Surti and stole drugs from him.
Surti is in coma and if he regains consciousness, Guffu and Viswapal will lose their heads.Constable Manohar (Aasmaan Bhardwaj) is Rajiv's driver and asks him to meet Inspector Poonam Sandhu aka Pammi (Tabu), who is close to the Commissioner Of Police (Ashwini Mishra).
Pammi agrees to help Guffu/Gopal Tiwari and Viswapal for Rs 2 Crores. Harry (Ashish Vidyarthi) is Pammi's friend. Harry retired from the force 2 years ago and now does private security that handles ATM cash deliveries for banks.
Harry says that his company handles cash deliveries for a large part of Mumbai's ATMs and carries Rs 2-4 Crores at any given time.Viswapal and Guffu have a falling out as Viswapal does not have Rs 1 Crores to save himself. He threatens Guffu that he will turn a government witness, but Guffu threatens back that if he wants he can pin the whole thing on Viswapal and walk Scott free.Guffu gathers a team of corrupt officers to attack Harry's cash van that night and offers to split anything over Rs 1 Crores equally between them. The heist goes badly as all the corrupt officers are gunned down by the van guards. Harry & Mamu escapes. Guffu is shot but survives and kills everybody else inside the van. He takes control of the van with its driver and takes off.
But the van is ambushed by Lovely and Daanish. Mamu finds a Scooty and follows the van.Chapter 2:
Guffu meets Narayan after the attack on Surti. Guffu has not been paid the hit money as Surti is still alive. Turns out Lovely (Radhika Madan) is Narayan's daughter. Guffu wants weapons for the cash van heist and asks for Narayan's help.
Lovely wanted to attend her friend's birthday party and stay overnight. Narayan sends Danny Dandekar aka Daanish (Shardul Bhardwaj) with her. Lovely has sex with Daanish in the car and it is clear that they are in a relationship, even though Lovely is getting married in 2 weeks. Lovely wants to elope with Daanish and escape to Canada. But they need Rs 1 Crores to accomplish this.Lovely and Daanish see Guffu entering a bar and follow him. They hear him plan out the cash van heist with the corrupt police officers. They follow Guffu and witness the heist and ambush the van when Guffu tries to drive away with it.
They put Guffu in their car and set it on fire and escape with the van, since the money box is chained to the van and there are no keys.
But Guffu again survives as he gets thrown out of the car before it explodes.Further ahead, the van is ambushed by Viswapal & Pammi, who shoots at Daanish with the rifle and the van crashes.
Guffu stops Mamu on the Scooty and goes with him after the van.Chapter 3:
Turns out Pammi had arrested 3 men who were supplying arms to Naxals. They offer Pammi a bribe of Rs 3 Crores in the form of a cash van, whose driver is from their village. Pammi wants Viswapal to execute as he also doesn't have the Rs 1 Crore he needs for the bribe he needs to pay.
The driver is Mamu (Vijayant Kohli) who says that he is on leave for 1 week and if he returns to work on the day the van is hijacked, he will be the prime suspect.
He says that if the replacement Ganesh is not able to come for some reason, then the company will call him back. Pammi and Viswapal find Ganesh in a Chawl smoking weed and arrest him. But Ganesh falls on railway tracks and dies under an oncoming local train.When Pammi and Viswapal stop the van, they are astonished to find Lovely inside. They cannot kill her as Narayan will set fire to the entire city.But now, Guffu and Mamu also reach the van on their Scooty. Mamu is killed in the shootout.
By morning, the Naxals led by Lakshmi reach the area and the 3 groups decide to join forces against the Naxals. They take refuge in a nearby ruin, which was a base for the Naxals.
Viswapal negotiates with Lakshmi and secures everyone's release in exchange for the money, but that's when Guggu finds a heavy machine gun in the ruins and decides to attack everybody.
In the ensuing shootout, Daanish is killed. Lovely kills Lakshmi and Pammi kills Lovely. Guffu shoots Pammi. Viswapal attacks Guffu, but is killed when a slab of concrete falls on Viswapal's head.
Guffu is the only survivor and escapes with the cash, which he hides in the jungle.Guffu is given a medal of honor for killing Naxals. 3 weeks later, Guffu goes to the ruins to recover the cash. But the same night, the PM declares demonetization.</p>

                            <p>Description: Blondi became a mother when she was just 15 years old. Today her son Mirko is a twenty-something with a talent for comic books and she is a woman who acts more like a best friend than a mother, sharing different hobbies with him, such as going out to concerts, and the consumption of alcohol and weed. The only difference between them is that Mirko is looking for a future in the form of a scholarship that he dreams of winning to study abroad, while Blondi finds herself living in eternal adolescence. In addition, Blondi also has to act as an anchor for her sister, who is trapped in a routine marriage from which she wants to escape, as well as having to deal with her own mother. Thus, she starts to become an anti-stereotype that shows that responsibility and debauchery can coexist.—exe_malaga93</p>

                            <p>Description: Jemima "Jem" Starling is a 17-year-old girl raised in a fundamentalist Christian community in Kentucky. She desires to be a good Christian and is expected by her parents Paul and Heidi to be a role model for her four younger siblings. Jem's age necessitates that she begin the tradition of courting, and her mother encourages her to get acquainted with Ben Taylor, the pastor's youngest son who has a crush on Jem. But Jem finds Ben dull and immature. Her true passion is dance as a member of her church's dance troupe.After a performance at a church service, Jem is mortified when the pastor's wife points out that her bra is visible through her dress. Jem goes outside the church to cry in private, where she is seen by Owen, the pastor's 28-year-old son and Ben's older brother, who is smoking a cigarette in the corner. Owen has just returned to the community from doing missionary work with his wife in Puerto Rico. Before Jem leaves, he asks her not to tell anyone about his smoking.When Jem learns the troupe might disband due to not having a leader, she asks Owen, who is in charge of church programs, if she can be appointed the leader, which he allows after some hemming and hawing. She develops a crush on Owen, who has come back to Kentucky with a newly relaxed view on church doctrine, and seeks ways to get closer to the older man. Unlike others who tell Jem she is participating in dance for vanity-related reasons and not to praise God, Owen is encouraging of her hobby.When Jem's demonstration of a routine is met with dislike from troupe members, she stays behind at the church one night, sitting alone dejectedly and praying. Owen happens to be working late that night and catches her mid-prayer, inviting her to come hang out in the kitchen with him. He tells her he found an unclaimed pair of seashell earrings in the church's lost and found bin and offers them to her. When Jem said she isn't allowed to wear earrings and doesn't have her ears pierced, she is spurred to pierce her ears herself as Owen watches. She successfully pierces her ear and the two share a kiss, beginning a sexual relationship. He and Jem regularly meet up in secret and he gives her a burner phone to communicate privately. One night, Jem asks Owen if he thinks she is wicked. He replies he does not, and reasons that because he feels truly alive with her, what they are doing can't possibly be a sin. He reveals his marriage to his wife Misty is an unhappy one because they married young and "misread the signs".Meanwhile, Jem's family situation becomes strained when Paul, a former alcoholic, relapses and loses his job. While alone with Paul one night, Jem learns he was a singer in a band before he converted to Christianity. He still listens to his old music on an iPod, which he keeps hidden from Heidi and swears Jem to secrecy about. Paul has begun drinking again to cope with the suicide of a former bandmate. When Jem asks Paul if he misses his musician life, he insists that the sacrifice is part of God's plan. Later, the troupe is asked to show their routine to Misty, who finds fault with the performance and says it needs to be adjusted so it's not so centered on Jem. This angers Jem, but she reluctantly complies. After practice, she keys Misty's car in retaliation.The following day, Owen has Jem come to his home and confronts her about the vandalism, warning her that any reckless behavior would give them away. Jem apologizes and the two make up, but Misty arrives home unexpectedly and Owen has Jem hide in the bathroom. While Jem stays in the bathtub, Owen instructs her he will notify her when the coast is clear for her to exit. However, hours pass by as Jem waits for his signal. She decides to leave on her own, but is nearly caught by Misty before climbing outside a window. When she escapes, she is witnessed by Rebecca, her younger sister. Jem later confesses to her that she and Owen are meant to be together, and when the time is right they will go public with their relationship.After this incident, Owen wants to take a break from the affair. Jem pleads with him not to and says she thinks it's time for them to come forward with their relationship, but Owen angrily refuses. Paul catches Jem lying to him about her whereabouts and punishes her by making her quit the troupe. During their argument, Jem accuses him of lying as well, prompting him to slap her. Later, he takes an overdose of Heidi's pills and attempts to apologize to Jem, but he has a seizure that leaves him in a coma.Heidi goes to stay by her husband's side at the hospital, leaving Jem to take her siblings to a church cookout. At the cookout, Jem frantically pleads with Owen to talk to her, but he avoids her. When the dance troupe performs their routine without Jem, she angrily storms off to the woods. A concerned Ben chases after her even though she tells him to leave her alone. She submerges herself in a pond and Ben follows, resulting in a struggle between the two teens and Jem nearly drowning Ben. Ben manages to get away, calling her a "psycho".Jem arrives back home that night to her mother, who is furious at her behavior towards Ben. Heidi also reveals she found Owen's burner phone, prompting Jem to confess. She insists she and Owen are "connected", to her mother's horror. Heidi calls her daughter "ruined" and declares Satan has taken hold of her. Though Jem apologizes and sobs, Heidi leaves her outside the house. Jem sleeps in the garage and is awoken by Pastor Taylor, who is now aware of everything. He sits down with Heidi and Jem and begins interrogating Jem about when the relationship started, seemingly placing the blame on the girl. When Jem asks about Owen and what he has to say, the pastor dismisses concerns about Owen, claiming Owen doesn't want to be there and how his life is now ruined due to losing his job and his wife wanting to leave him. According to the pastor, Owen says it was Jem who tempted him and "inhibited his ability to control himself". Heidi and the pastor resolve that Jem must spend some time away at King's Valley, a disciplinary camp. At church, Jem is asked to recant her sins in front of everyone. Multiple church members, including Owen, approach Jem to say, "I forgive you." Jem visits her dad in the hospital and takes his jacket with her, packing it in her bags for her stay at the camp.As Jem is preparing to leave home, she is stopped by Owen, who declares he has left Misty and wants to be with Jem. He says that his dad got in his head but he's now made up his mind and wants to go back to Puerto Rico with Jem. Heidi comes outside and punches Owen, but Jem defies her and leaves with Owen in his car. The two take up residence at a motel. While putting on her dad's jacket, she discovers her father's iPod in her pocket. She puts the ear phones in and listens to one of his songs. The following morning, without telling Owen, she sneaks away and takes his car. She drives to a Memphis bar her father told her he used to perform at with his band. While there, a song plays and she happily dances alone to it, losing herself in the dance.</p>

                            <p>Description: Mr. Tomasz, who sometimes introduced himself as Tomasz the Vagabond, was called by his friends Mr. Samochodzik. He owed his nickname to an unusual vehicle inherited from his uncle-inventor. This car, although ugly, "a cross between a canoe and a wheelbarrow", as the malicious people called it, had incredible capabilities: with a Ferrari 410 engine, it could run at a speed of 280 km per hour. Thanks to the screw used, it served as a motor boat. In this vehicle, Mr. Tomasz went to Poland to decipher another historical mystery, to catch thieves and smugglers trying to steal valuable historic items. Treasure hunting is great, but... it's better that no one interferes with it... In the meantime, some Danes and a suspicious group of Polish youth follow the trail of Mr. Samochodzik's search in the Teutonic castles and the headquarters of the Templars. To find the treasure you need a lot of knowledge, cunning and... a lot of luck. Who will have more?—G</p>

                            <p>Description: María, Nacho and Suso are three lifelong friends. The three have experienced many things together, some very beautiful and others not so much, things that united or separated them. And suddenly, in the middle of life, they must face death. The announced death of one of the three, who is suffering from a terminal illness. Before that happens, there are many matters to close: plans, promises, reproaches, laughter, reconciliations, apologies, memories, more laughter, tears, laughter again, pending issues and some other secret that perhaps the time has come to uncover. 'Friends Till Death' is a dramatic comedy. Or perhaps an emotional tragicomedy. Or maybe even a macabre romantic comedy. It is a comedy that laughs at death and a drama that suffers for a love that is reciprocated. María, Nacho and Suso will have to ask themselves many questions and they have very little time left to answer them. They probably don't have an easy answer to any of those questions, but what's certain is that the three of them will try to solve them together, because that's what they're 'Friends to death'.—Medio Limón Producciones S.L.</p>

They swear at her and even hope that the teacher will die. This oath is pronounced simultaneously as the Maghrib call to prayer. Not long after, Mrs. Woro dies tragically. Since then, Adi and Saman are experiencing a terrifying supernatural terror. There is a mysterious spirit in a teacher's uniform, just like the one Mrs. Woro wore when she died. Over time, terror threatens not only physically but also their souls. After slaughtering the village head's pet chicken, Saman fights his brother to death. After carrying out this bloody action, the teenager falls into a trance and commits suicide just as the Maghrib call to prayer resounds. Ayu suspects that there is a more frightening evil force behind this series of events. If she doesn't do something, Adi will have the same fate.</p>

                            <p>Description: Muthuvel Pandian (Rajinikanth) is a retired police officer who lives in Kodambakkam with his family. Muthuvel's son, ACP Arjun (Vasanth Ravi), is investigating Varman (Vinayakan), an eccentric gangster who smuggles idols of gods and sells them to buyers overseas, operating from his base of operations in Arakkonam.
Vijaya (Ramya Krishnan) is Muthuvel's wife, while Swetha (Mirnaa Menon) is Arjun's wife.Arjun has seized a container full of Varman's stolen idols from temples all over the country. Varman is livid and sends his henchman Seenu to deal with Arjun.
Arjun confronts Varman's henchman, Seenu (Saravanan) and demands him about the whereabouts of Varman. Seenu abducts Muthuvel, but Muthuvel ends up thrashing the goons instead. Arjun arrests Seenu and beats him to get Varman's location. The whole department is worried that Arjun's actions will wake a sleeping devil.
Seenu is released from police custody.As Arjun gets closer to nabbing Varman, he suddenly goes missing and the police department spreads word that he may have committed suicide to cover up that he was probably killed by Varman.
Grieving the loss of his son and partly blaming himself for raising him to be honest and fearless, Muthuvel goes after Seenu and murders him, disposing of the body with the help of a local taxi driver Vimal (Yogi Babu).Varman's men make an attempt on Muthuvel's grandson, Rithvik (Rithvik), despite Muthuvel convincing Varman to leave him and his family alone. Varman vows to kills Muthuvel's entire family to set an example for his men.
Enraged, Muthuvel decides to fight back. Muthuvel brutally beheads the 2 men sent by Varman to attack his grandson. He then shifts his family to a mental hospital for their safety.
Muthuvel visits Narasimha (Shiva Rajkumar), a reformed criminal living in Mandya, who loans him four of his sharpshooters.
With the help of Narasimha's men, Muthuvel blackmails and humiliates Varman. Muthuvel hijacks one of Varman's trucks which was full of stolen idols headed for the overseas markets. Varman was about to attack Muthuvel's family at the mental hospital, when Muthuvel informs Varman that he has knowledge of all his smuggling routes and vows to destroy his entire business if his family is not left alone. Muthuvel asks Varman to beg for Rs 10 from his family, as a price to release his hijacked truck.Muthuvel brings his family back home.
Varman then has a Bihari gangster, Kamdev (Jackie Shroff), send people to kill Muthuvel and his family at his home, only for them to be gunned down. Muthuvel reveals his truth to his family that he is a vicious killer when needed.After discovering Varman's target to be Muthuvel, Kamdev reveals to him that Muthuvel was once the ruthless and charismatic jailer of Tihar prison, who was also known as "Tiger" Muthuvel Pandian. He disciplined the criminals harshly but also helped them reform, gaining a massive network of allies, including Kamdev.Muthuvel corners Varman in his base, but he reveals to him that Arjun is still alive and threatens to kill him. Both of them ultimately arrive at a compromise: Varman will release Arjun in return for a famous antique crown that is currently secure in a temple in Mangalagiri, Andhra Pradesh.Muthuvel plans a heist involving the Telugu actor, Blast Mohan (Sunil), who is a trustee of the temple where the crown is held. 10 gangs have tried to steal the crown so far, and all of them ended up in jail.
Blast Mohan is making a film with actress Kamna (Tamannaah) and Muthuvel goes to the sets to meet him. Mohan is in love with Kamna and buys a Rs 1.5 Crores ring for her. But he sends the ring via his director Balu (Sunil Reddy). Balu tells Kamna that he is in love with her and the ring is from his side.
Muthuvel blackmails Balu to change the story and include a scene that involves the stealing of the Mangalagiri temple crown.With various deceptions and with the help of a smuggler in Mumbai named Mathew (Mohanlal), Muthuvel executes his plan to steal the crown. He shoots a footage of Blast Mohan stealing the crown and uploads it to the CCTV footage of the temple camera. The CBI believes Blast Mohan stole the real crown. They bring it out of safe keeping and decide to transfer it for even tighter security. Muthuvel launches an attack on the convoy that transports the crown.Muthuvel eventually comes into possession of the crown and sends it back to Varman. It is later revealed that the crown he sent was a fake. Even the entire convoy encounter was a fake, only executed to convince Varman that the real crown had been stolen.Varman frees Arjun, who reveals himself as a corrupt police officer that wants to be cut in on Varman's operations, willing to kill his own father for money. However, the fake crown also conceals a hidden camera, and their entire conversation is recorded and seen by Muthuvel.
He attacks Varman's hideout with Kamdev, Vimal, and his allies, killing Varman and his men, while Narasimha protects Muthuvel's family and Mathew destroys Varman's smuggling operations.

                            <p>Description: The story of Harold Ballard is the story of one of Canada's most iconic characters. Owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs for two decades of rollicking, headline-grabbing mayhem, Ballard liked nothing more than a good time, a full cash register, and the attention of anyone who'd listen. And if you weren't listening, he was so interesting, you had no choice.From the day he assumed ownership until his death in 1990, Harold Ballard was a magnet for publicity, a force of nature who dominated Canadian media, and this documentary is aimed at both those familiar with Ballard and those new to his epic story. Married to the love of his life, Ballard was the father of three children and three thousand stories. Our film will span from his early days as an only child to a stint at Upper Canada College and then to when he arrived in the front office with the Toronto Marlboros, eventually gaining control of the Toronto Maple Leafs --plus Maple Leaf Gardens and all that went with it.Rock concerts, Muhammad Ali, Billy Graham revivals; Ballard had it all at the Gardens. He was a promoter without peer, and whether you were one of Ballard's coaches (he hired and fired a dozen of them), Hall-of-Fame centreman Darryl Sittler, or The Beatles --who Ballard talked into doing a double-bill at Maple Leaf Gardens --the pressure to succeed was relentless. Friendships started, partnerships dissolved; at one point, Ballard ended up in prison for white collar crimes. But through it all, he gave untold millions to charity (untold indeed -he never liked to publicize his largess), during a life that was a true roller coaster ride. And when the dust settled, Harold Ballard was a very rich man who'd led a very rich life.Bottom line: Ballard thrived on being unconventional --when trying to secure a massive bank loan to buy the Leafs, for collateral Ballard used... the Leafs? The asset he was trying to buy?? The plan was so audacious, absurd, and remarkable, that it worked.Because Harold Ballard was so audacious, absurd, and remarkable that he worked.</p>

                            <p>Description: This timely documentary chronicles the tech-fueled rise and Fyre-style fall of HQ Trivia, the revolutionary "game show on your phone" app that went viral, swept the nation, then crashed and burned. The global live-play game sensation drew millions of daily users to its frenetically fun trivia challenges and cash prizes, attracting celebrity fans including Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Neil Patrick Harris, Jimmy Kimmel, and Kelly Clarkson. But its success was undone by corporate clashes, cast changes, and a tragic death. Told through the eyes of former host Scott Rogowsky and other first-person players from inside and outside the company, the film documents the real-life comedy and tragedy that unfolded in front of and behind the cameras.</p>

                            <p>Description: Ajay Dixit (Varun Dhawan) is a History teacher but is embarrassed that he hasn't achieved more in life, and that is why he has lied to everyone he knows that he fell behind due to circumstances. He could have been a cricketer if not for his tennis elbow; he could have been an IAS officer but wanted to teach kids to be IAS instead; or he fell sick right before an important exam, which is why he is now teaching history instead of already being a part of it. These are some of the lies he has told around the whole town to "maintain an image." Ajay loves his image in town and wants to protect it at all costs.
The Principal (Shashie Vermaa) of the school gets several complaints from fellow teachers who believe Ajay is a fake, but due to lack of any evidence, the Principal does not take any action.
Ajay also lives with his parents and buys expensive items to maintain his aura in town. His dad refuses to fund his lavish lifestyle.Ajay married Nisha (Janhvi Kapoor) some nine months ago, but he has never liked her. Nisha told him before they got married that she had epilepsy, but since she hadn't had a fit in over ten years, Ajay decided it wasn't a problem for him. Ajay married Nisha because he thought she would help him enhance his image. While Nisha selected Ajay as she saw him as friendly and compassionate, not knowing that it was only his image.
However, on the day of their marriage, she had a fit, and since then, Ajay has been disappointed in her because he is embarrassed about other people finding out. He doesn't let her work a job or even take her anywhere because he is scared of what people will think of him if she has a fit again. Nisha has not left him because she has some hope.One morning in school, when he is in a particularly bad mood, he slaps one of his students Atul (Nikhil Chawla) for asking him a question related to the subject. Atul wanted to know why prisoners were stripped of their clothes before being taken to gas chambers in concentration camps. When Ajay couldn't answer, Atul mocked him for not knowing, hence prompting the slap.That gets him into trouble because the boy is the MLA's Vishwas Raghuvanshi (Mukesh Tiwari) son, and he gets involved. Ajay is suspended for a few days, and he could potentially lose his job, which he cannot afford because he wants to keep up his image.
Therefore, he comes up with a plan to go on a tour of Europe and visit all the places relevant to World War II so that he can teach the kids about them through a live-stream, covering up the fact of his incompetence in the classroom. He plans on taking Nisha with him so that his father Mr Dixit (Manoj Pahwa) will agree to finance the trip, but he tells her that it is only for show, and he is not actually interested in their relationship.
When Nisha thanks Ajay, he retorts that he only included her so that his father would fund the trip. He actually wants Nisha to go to her home from the airport and meet him only once he returns.A fed-up Nisha decides not to put up with his nonsense anymore and to go to Europe regardless. He could go his way, and she would do what she wanted. Unfortunately, though, things immediately go wrong for Ajay, and his bag is exchanged with another man Kalpesh (Vyas Hemang), leaving Ajay with terrible clothes for the duration of his trip. He is also not able to figure out his day and how to go about the city, while Nisha goes on to have an excellent time. When they get back to the hotel, Ajay sees this and understands that he needs her help to navigate Europe, and Nisha agrees, saying that she isn't going to abandon him the way he did to her.Since Ajay is shameless and Nisha is a pushover, this couple sets out to explore the city, and it is Nisha who tells Ajay the facets of history that he then starts relaying to his students. Nisha narrates stories like how the people of Paris left their city when Hitler arrived, so that he would not ruin their beautiful city. But they cut the cables of the Eiffel tower, so he could not view the city from above.
They hire an audio guide for 5 euros and relive the harrowing first hour of Omaha beach at Normandy on June 6th, 1944. 10,000 soldiers died.
They visit the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam.Nisha really comes through for Ajay by getting his mobile phone back from a thief, settling a fight, and even showing her resourcefulness by cooking food with the hot water from the bathroom. Ajay starts seeing Nisha as a person instead of someone he used to tolerate in his house. They start coming closer every day, and Ajay even starts getting possessive over her.
Back in Lucknow, his videos on history are a hit and are gaining good attention, despite the MLA insisting that a committee be set up to decide on his suspension.When a video of Ajay dancing with Nisha is uploaded by her on her social media page, it goes viral, and Ajay is furious since he believes that it could hurt his chances with his job. In his anger, he says some really mean things to her, and Nisha finally decides to leave him behind and sign the divorce papers back home.Ajay visits a Berlin Museum, where he sees the last things that the people grabbed before they were scurried away to concentration camps. When he imagines himself in their situation, he realizes that Nisha means something to him, and he asks her to stay back for the rest of the trip instead of leaving midway. Nisha agrees. This is just another undeserved chance for Ajay.
When they are in Auschwitz, they meet a concentration camp survivor who tells them how he should have paid more attention to his wife. Ajay relates this to his own situation, and this is what it took for him to learn to see Nisha as a person instead of a "misfire," as he called her and their marriage.
This time, when she has a fit, he is there for her and really takes care of her.Ajay returns to India and tells the committee that he was never a good teacher and will accept whatever verdict they have reached. To his surprise, the committee decided in his favor because when they conducted a test for the students, they all aced it, thanks to Ajay's history lessons from Europe.
Now that Ajay is a changed man, he has the respect of the MLA and the approval of all of his students, meaning that he is going to live his life as a changed person with the help of his wife.</p>

                            <p>Description: Jackie Martling just may be America's last great joke teller. His savant-like ability to remember every joke he's heard since he was 8 years old, combined with his lightning fast wit and infectious laugh helped established him as a comedy icon. Famous for being the head writer of the Howard Stern show for 15 years, and infamous for leaving that position, Jackie's story is fascinating, funny and surprising. In an age of political correctness, Jackie "The Joke Man" Martling helps us belly-laugh at ourselves with a kindness and sincerity that defuses his unfiltered punch lines.—Ian Karr</p>

                            <p>Description: After the Big Bang some 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was filled with hydrogen and helium gases, which eventually started to bond together, forming stars. These stars are then believed to have grouped into galaxies in a phenomenon that is termed the "first light" in space astronomy. It is believed that the beginning of life, in a sense, took place after this very phenomenon, and there has been a constant interest in knowing more about it. This is theoretically possible with the help of space telescopes, as they can be thought of as a means to know the past. It is based on the principle that light takes time to travel through space. Therefore, the images that we see through a space telescope of planets and galaxies many light-years away from the Earth are actually from the time that has already passed, i.e., images from the past. Although witnessing the "first light" still remains a theoretical possibility and is the ultimate goal of these studies, the advancement in space telescopes is immense as well.It was in 1990 that the first major breakthrough in using space telescopes to find out about space took place, with the launch of the Hubble telescope. While outer space was believed to be empty and dark, photographs taken by the Hubble telescope of planets and galaxies many light-years away amazed the world. Images of colorful clusters of light all across the vast space became a point of conversation and intrigue about the possibilities in space, including whether other life forms exist somewhere in some galaxy far away. Ever since the success of the Hubble telescope, NASA and other space research centers had been working on a far superior telescope that can look even further into space and ultimately came up with the James Webb Space Telescope.While the Hubble telescope had already been able to capture some young galaxies, the central idea of the newer, much more advanced JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) is to witness galaxies and events as close to the Big Bang as possible. With advancements in almost every aspect of the physical capabilities of the telescope, the JWST is much more capable than the Hubble, most notably in its much bigger mirrors. The James Webb telescope is also powerful enough to study the molecules in a specific planet's atmosphere, through which it can be identified whether the planet is habitable or not. Therefore, the James Webb telescope actually promises to be able to answer multiple questions with just one operation and one piece of machinery.Along with being the most powerful and effective telescope imaginable to mankind, the James Webb Telescope also had some major problems associated with it. It was because of these problems that its launch mission became one of the most difficult operations ever conducted by NASA and other space programs. The launch was a joint operation conducted by the pioneering space agencies of the world, i.e., CSA, ESA and NASA and, and it had been announced way back in the 1990s. At the time of this announcement, the telescope was projected to be ready by 2007 and was estimated to cost somewhere around 500 million dollars. However, all commentators in the documentary film agree that this price estimation was totally inaccurate, for it was almost common knowledge that the JWST would most definitely cost much more.Eventually, as the project began in full swing and got much delayed than the projected time-line, the cost of building the James Webb telescope exceeded 6 billion dollars. The first major difficulty that space engineers faced with regards to the project came in 2011, when Congress considered pulling funds away and canceling the project altogether. It was presumably with great effort (Cosmic Time Machine does not get too much into it) that the NASA team convinced Congress not to abandon the work they had already done. Ultimately, the government agreed to pay more money for the work, and a new head was appointed to it, with an estimated total of 9 billion dollars used on JWST.Although the financial and administrative pressure was somewhat eased, problems related to the sheer complexity of the telescope remained. One of the most basic problems faced was that the circumference of the gigantic telescope would always be greater than that of the rocket on which it needed to be strapped and sent to outer space. Because of this, the James Webb telescope had to be folded in parts and assembled in that manner, in order to be compact enough to be carried by a rocket. This, in turn, obviously increased the number of moving mechanical parts on the telescope, which increased the number of possible failures with regards to the operation.The parts and mechanisms used on the telescope were intricate and, at the same time, quite flimsy compared to previous telescopes because of its special requirements. During a series of tests conducted with regards to the real temperatures, pressures, and other conditions that the telescope would have to go through in space, the JWST came up with multiple failures, setting the engineers back in time and money. The grand scale of the telescope, and therefore the operation, meant that a large team of space scientists and engineers had to work on the whole matter, further increasing the resources spent and also making it more difficult to manage every aspect of the project.A term called "single point failures" is used to describe the exact extent of risk involved in the JWST launch. Single-point failure refers to any single failure or breakdown in the entire telescope and rocket that can instantly make the entire operation fail. The riskiest operation before the James Webb telescope, which was the Mars Perseverance mission in 2021, involved around 80 to 90 single-point failures. Whereas, in the case of the James Webb launch, the total number of single-point failures was a massive 344, meaning that 344 intricate and crucial matters had to work exactly as intended in order to make the whole operation a success.
225 of those failure points were related to the unfurling of the sub-shield. The flimsy sun-shield was tested for full scale deployment over three times and still a million things could go wrong with it.Considering the many possibilities of failure, the successful launch of the telescope in December 2021 was a staggering feat in itself. The rocket carrying the telescope was perfectly launched into the sky from an ESA spaceport in French Guiana, and it also successfully detached the telescope at the desired location in outer space. The extensive mirrors of the satellite had to then be rolled out remotely through software codes written and executed on Earth. A massive reflector sheet, so that the telescope does not get burned out by the reflections of the Sun, moon, and Earth, also had to be rolled out in a similar manner. By the end of the schedule, all of these operations had taken place as intended, and the James Webb telescope launch was a grand success.Since the telescope has started to operate and take photographs of faraway galaxies in space, some more magnificent visuals from outer space have reached us. The fact that the James Webb telescope is much more powerful and better equipped than the previous Hubble telescope has been proven through these images. Unknown: Cosmic Time Machine also gives a very brief glimpse at how the photographs sent from the telescope are then presented to the public.The documentary also features President Joe Biden releasing the first photograph taken by the telescope to the public as a celebration of the grand success of the long-drawn operation. So far, the James Webb telescope has been able to find an exoplanet quite similar to Earth, many light-years away. The risk of the telescope and the operation failing still remains, owing to the fact that the telescope has been placed so far away from the Earth that no astronaut can manually go and fix things like it did with the Hubble telescope. But the possibility of finding new information about space and other galaxies also makes the James Webb telescope a matter of great excitement.</p>

                            <p>Description: Domestic conflicts that are being experienced by Angkasa and Lika. As the father of Angkasa, Narendra certainly tries to defuse the situation experienced by his son. But, the different views on life and marriage make the discussion between the two to find a solution tough. Until finally we are brought back to the past when Narenda fought for the love of Ajeng who is of a different caste economically. The story of this love struggle will take place in 1987, where young Narendra tries to win the heart of young Ajeng. Even though they have different conflicts and stories, the struggle for love between Narenda and Angkasa can be united by a red line, a sentence "Love will mean more when it is fought for".</p>

                            <p>Description: A double murder in a tropical Australian bayou of crocodiles and mangrove swamps unravels a dynastic alliance between formidable fishing clans. An ill-fated love gone horribly wrong sees questions of guilt and complicity ripple out far beyond the killers. What are the unforeseen consequences of the small choices we all make in our lives? How does an unyielding landscape imprint upon us? And who do we become in a world without rules?THE CAPE is a wrenching psychological journey into a story about the nature of guilt and complicity born of the unsuspecting power of the small choices we all make in our lives. Choices that, once accumulated one upon the other, become possessed of a cascading force.It is set in a small world within an unending expanse. A tiny community of hard-bitten fishing clans who work the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria in Australia's remote, Western Cape York Peninsula and live in ramshackle coastal encampments amid the mangrove swamps.They are an unseen culture to themselves, with their own rules and rhythms, that even Australians do not know exist.
Theirs is a land of crocodiles, sharks, and wet seasons that swallow the region whole for five months of the year. Their work is gruelling and ceaseless. Nets are laid from precarious dinghies, then harvested of prized barramundi as giant crocs and predators roam.These families raise themselves; so isolated, their children are educated by schools over two-way radios; for seasons on end each clan only encounters the other; outsiders are few, and usually transient.
Some, however, do know these clans. At least as anyone can. Those who've tried their hand at the life of a Barra fisherman and learned the hard way. The Traditional Owners who forage the land to this day. Former deckhands. The fisheries inspector who has long tried to monitor their operations. The Mayor of the Aboriginal Council. The Ranger who protects the rivers for future generations. A grizzled country cop who's spent years keeping them in check.They are our voices of The Gulf. They carry us through our journey. They are our guides, our sages, our confidantes, our Greek chorus. We turn to them. To help us understand what's happening before us and to weigh the deeds as they are done. These voices, too, navigate our story through an Indigenous world. For the Gulf is a land of First Peoples. It is a black community with white stories encased within.Throughout the film these Gulf voices sow our thematic seeds: of isolation, of a small society unbound by societal norms, of an overwhelming landscape's power to shape the lives of those who live in it, and of the nature of our guilt.
For when the disappearance on an eerily calm sea of a 10-year-old boy and his father turns into a murder investigation, a hidden story is revealed.The boy's mother is having an affair with a childhood friend from another clan who'd never stopped pining for her. A tale unravels of two matriarchs manoeuvring to bring the illicit lovers together in an alliance of the two dynasties. Dynasties on a journey from a place of warm gatherings and family get-togethers into the shadows and darkness of mercenary plotting. The emergence of a scheme for the murdered father, an outsider brought into this world, to be quietly shut out.
And how choices made as a marriage deteriorates unconsciously leads to a little boy's death - surely an unintended consequence of a plan gone very, very wrong.We see how one act of violence radiates guilt far beyond the killers. Through whole families. Through an entire community.
Questions of complicity, and the very nature of guilt, shroud them all. In THE CAPE we interrogate these themes, and these people. With subtlety. But with the journalistic ferocity this story demands. Hidden ambitions are unearthed. Hopes metamorphosed into ugly display. Secret chambers of people's souls revealed.How do these dynastic harmonies go so terribly wrong? How do our choices, with effects both intended and unintended, tear apart so many lives? Within this foreign place there is the recognisable, everyday pain of humanity. We can all see some piece of our own lives within those of these clans. Unexpected pregnancies, the slow and gut-wrenching breakdown of a marriage, the seduction of illicit affairs. But few of us exist in a world so absent the guardrails of civilization.This is how these people have come to live with murderers amongst them. For all those living in The Gulf, this is a story - so far - without resolution.This is the bizarre, dark journey of THE CAPE. Entering a land so other-worldly, inhabited by people seemingly so different, that their lives cannot possibly mirror those of our own cosseted humanity. And yet, they do. Within the shared threads of the human experience the audience finds in these real-life characters, comes also the darkness that dwells within us all.</p>

                            <p>Description: After an oil refinery in Iraq owned by Chinese firm Unicorp gets attacked by mercenaries led by Owen Paddock (Pilou Asbaek). The refinery is led by Director of Operations Professor Cheng, who invites private security firms to lead a rescue operation for the civilians at the refinery.Ex-special forces soldier "Dragon" Luo Feng (Jackie Chan) leads his private security company in evacuating the civilian employees in a convoy along the Highway of Death to the safety of the Green Zone.
Cheng tells Feng that the mercenaries wanted control of the refinery and did not want to destroy it. Cheng shuts down the refinery before leaving with Feng in a rescue convoy. Luo Mei (Ma Chunrui) is Cheng's assistant.
Feng answered Cheng's call as Mei is his estranged daughter.Meanwhile, needing money to fix a well in a rural village, former US Marine Chris Van Horne (John Cena) reluctantly joins his mercenary brother Henry (Amadeus Serafini) in attacking the convoy. Henry claims they are tracking down a man responsible for attacking them years earlier, which led to the death of 5 of their comrades.
The village is out of water, and Chris needs $100,000 to bribe Unicorp, who control the water supply to the village. Owen is the middleman between Chris and Unicorp, and he paints Unicorp as the main villain to Chris.The mercenaries create a massive sandstorm and use it to cover their attack. After the convoy fends them off and clears the sandstorm, Feng discovers that 2 buses out of 11 have been kidnapped, including Professor Cheng who has the authorization codes to the oil refinery.
Feng brings back his helicopters and asks for Mei's help to search for the missing buses. Chris manages to fight off one helicopter and escapes with Cheng into the desert canyons.
Feng finds the missing buses and finds that 5 engineers including Cheng have been taken hostage.Chris confronts Henry concerning the kidnapping as he is not convinced that Cheng was responsible for the death of their comrades. Chris wants to know who hired him and Henry. Owen reveals himself as the mastermind. Owen says that he worked for Unicorp for 16 years and got nothing. Now, this is his time to get rich.
Owen tells him that he intends to reactivate the refinery and profit off the oil trade. Owen wants Chris to keep Feng away from Cheng, and only then he will pay what he owes Chris and Henry.
After an enraged Chris leaves, Owen shoots Henry for failing to kill Feng.Feng tracks down Chris as he travels across the desert in his dune buggy and confronts him. Chris believes that feng shot Henry, while Feng believes that Chris killed his men. Chris and Feng team together to fight off the French, who had supplied weapons to Chris and Henry, and are now contracted by Owen to kill Chris.
Feng learns about his intentions in taking the job and helping the children in his village. Chris tells Feng that Owen is behind the kidnapping.
After Owen scares Professor Cheng into cooperating, he sends his men to find her bag which contains the codes. Cheng had left her phone in her bag and Owen is tracking the same.
The bag was with Mei from the beginning and Mei was with Chris and Feng. Owen's men reach Chris's village for the bag. Chris gives it up to protect the village.
Mei tells Chris and Feng that the refinery will deliver millions of barrels of petroleum products to the coast via a network of underground pipelines. This will be the biggest oil heist in history.Chris and Feng return to the refinery, defeat Owen's men and foil his plans. Chris and Feng team up to rescue Cheng and her son from the refinery control room. Owen escapes the refinery with a few trucks full of gasoline.
Chris and Feng chase with down with a jet engine truck, which was originally used by Chris to whip up the sandstorm in the desert.
Owen is killed in an ensuing car chase. Afterwards Feng and his team arrest the perpetrator behind the oil heist. Van Horne fixes the well and is offered and accepts a new mission with Feng.</p>

                            <p>Description: In the Italian Alps, an MI6 team is tasked with extracting potential asset and arms dealer, Mulvaney. Rachel Stone (Gal Gadot), officially in the tech support team in a van with Bailey (Paul Ready), is called upon to enter the ski lodge casino to be near enough to hack into security's encryption key. Rachel is not a field agent but has to do this as the internet is not working and physically hacking into the phone of the head of security is the only way to gain access.To maintain her cover while in the casino Stone plays one hand of blackjack, then apparently disappearing. Field agents Parker (Jamie Dornan) and Yang (Jing Lusi) are given access to the restricted gambling area. They find that people are betting on the body count of an actual combat between US Navy seals and some terrorists. Someone has found a way to hack into military grade encryption.
Their plan to inject Mulvaney to fake a heart attack is thwarted by his bodyguard. However, Parker is able to isolate and take him on a cable car.
Their communications are infiltrated by Keya Dhawan (Alia Bhatt), who reveals that she knew that the MI6 were coming.Stone and Yang can see that more of Mulvaney's men are converging at the base of the cable car station. There is no way that Parker survives unless MI6 gets there first.
Meanwhile, Stone feigns a twisted ankle, so the MI6 goes on without her.Stone reconnects with Charter, the secret peace-keeping organization, to help the MI6 team incognito. Hoping to prevent Mulvaney's security team from taking out Parker, Jack (Matthias Schweighöfer) guides Stone so she can get ahead of the cable car. Jack helps Stone get a parachute and ski down the mountain ahead of the cable car.
Stone takes out the six-man security team, hiding the bodies. However, Mulvaney takes cyanide before they can stop him.Back in London, the MI6 team are reprimanded for botching the job. Later that night, as the team wind down together, they speculate about the rumored Charter. Charter is rumored to be a group of ex-intelligence operatives who answer only to themselves. Highly trained agents working together to keep peace in the world. Doing things their governments never allowed them to do.
MI6 believes that Keya works for Charter. MI6 is worried that someone has hacked military grade encryption and that is their next mission.Stone goes to Charter headquarters where the head Nomad (Sophie Okonedo) criticizes her actions. Charter has found Keya, who is the hacker who broke the military grade encryption. She was an orphan in Pune, when a Billionaire Niam Kharche discovered her talent and took her under his wing. But then Keya fell in with a bunch of criminals and she is 22 years old now.
Keya had set up the casino gambit to lure Mulvaney. Mulvaney was tracking a Quantum Computer called "The Heart" capable for hacking anything, anywhere.Charter have located Keya in Lisbon. The plan is to leak the location to MI6 and have Stone's MI6 team to pursue her.
In Lisbon, the MI6 team are ambushed by several people. Although Stone is given an escape route by Jack, she opts to stay and save her MI6 team. She blows her cover in doing so, only for Parker to kill the other team members. He paralyzes Stone as he says that he's going after "The Heart." Parker says that he and Keya knew that the Charter had infiltrated the MI6 and Parker's mission was to find out who. Parker reveals that Mulvaney told him that "The Heart" is the source of the Charter's powers. Its modeling is so accurate that it can predict the future. If you own the Heart, you own the World. Only a Charter member can reveal where The Heart is located.Parker injects Rachel with a hacking device. As Rachel is discovered by the Charter recovery team, she is taken to their HQ. Where, using the device inside Rachel, Keya is able to hack into Charter's systems and access The Heart. Rachel regains consciousness, stabs herself to eject the device and destroys it. But the systems were hacked for 3 minutes and 45 seconds.Jack reveals that The Heart is 85,000 feet up in the atmosphere in a blimp called The Locker. Rachel recommends shutting it down, as they don't know what Keya is capable of.
Nomad takes Rachel off the case. She says that had Rachel escaped, like she was told, everyone would still be alive, and The Heart would have been safe.Charter assigns names to agents like a deck of cards.
Nomad, the King of Hearts, meets the other Kings. King of Clubs (BD Wong), King of Diamonds (Glenn Close) and King of Spades (Mark Ivanir).
The Kings reveal that Parker was in Chechnya in 2015. He was working for MI6 stopping delivery of weapons to a Chechen warlord. But he was trapped, and his entire team was killed. Charter was monitoring and couldn't allow the weapons into Chechen hands. The Kings ordered a drone strike, that took out the weapons. They thought Parker had died, but he survived.
Parker knows it was Charter who ordered the drone strike and is out for revenge.Rachel works on her own and uses Keya hacks to trace her back. Rachel tracks Keya in West Africa and she is going after The Locker. Keya used her hack to plant a code that will control the Locker and drop it to 40,000 feet. Parker will have 8 minutes to take The Heart, before Charter regains control and takes The Locker back up to 85,000 feet.
Charter detects the hack, but there is no agent within 500 miles of the Locker. Rachel had already traveled to Africa was in the air, skydiving her way to The Locker. Meanwhile Keya and Parker used a chopper to get to The Locker and were already inside.Rachel manages to get on board The Locker. As Rachel attacks Parker, Keya steals The Heart. Parker manages to escape, but Rachel gets hold of Keya and they both plummet to the ground as Parker blows up The Locker. Rachel uses Keya's parachute to land them both safely in the middle of the Senegal desert. Parker has The Heart, but it is useless without Keya as she has put her bio-metrics on it.
Rachel refuses to kill Keya, even though Keya knows that's the logical play. Keya says that Niam conducted medical experiments that killed her parents. She wants to use The Heart to expose all Billionaires like Niam.
Rachel offers that Charter can take down Niam, without Keya having to destroy the Charter. Rachel puts a tracker on Keya.They reach a town, where they are shot at by mercenaries paid by Parker's men. Rachel manages to escape, but Keya is captured. Rachel is rescued by another Charter agent called Six of Hearts.
Rachel is taken to Iceland, and Rachel informs Nomad, and they plan a strike on Parker. If Parker gets the Heart online, it will finish The Charter.As Rachel gets to Iceland, Parker plugs in The Heart and Keya activates it. Parker uses The Heart to kill King of Diamonds. They also find King of Hearts and her team in a bunker outside of London. Parker seals off the bunker and shuts off their ventilation system. Keya is distraught since the plan was to expose the Charter and not kill people.
King of Clubs also lands in Iceland with a strike team but is being tracker by Parker.Keya contacts Rachel secretly and reveals that she found her tracker. Parker is using it to lure Clubs and Rachel to a wrong location and trap them. Keya says that Rachel was right about Parker and sends her coordinates.
Rachel manages to escape, but King of Clubs and his entire team is destroyed as Parker remote detonates an explosive.
Keya locks out Parker from The Heart. Rachel makes her way to Parker's location and has 50 minutes to save Nomad.Rachel reaches Parker's real location and fights her way in. Keya helps Rachel in the fight against Parker and Rachel manages to shoot Parker down. Keya activates the Heart and opens the bunker, saving the entire Hearts team.
Rachel offers Keya to join the Charter.</p>

But when her sister Anna arrives in the city where Nina lived - with the hope and belief that her sister is still alive - the search for the truth behind the disappearance begins.

                            <p>Description: From Wikipedia:Peter is an eight-year-old boy living with his overbearing, yet emotionally distant parents Carol and Mark. He is often bullied at school and has no friends or any social life. One day, Peter elects to stay inside during recess, and earns some sympathy from his substitute teacher Miss Devine. Despite having plans to go trick-or-treating on Halloween Night, his parents forbid him due to the disappearance of a young girl several years ago.Later that night, Peter is awoken by a tapping sound coming from inside the bedroom walls. Both his parents strongly deny these occurrences, insisting that he is imagining them. Over the next few days, Peter continues to talk with the mysterious entity, who he learns is named "Sarah". Sarah claims that she was trapped in the walls by Peter's parents, calling them "evil"; leaving Peter disturbed.Devine becomes concerned after seeing a picture that Peter drew of Sarah asking for help in a dark room. Following a meeting with Peter's parents, they wave her off and, later on, Carol confronts and admonishes him for bringing his delusions into public scrutiny. Sarah continues to convince Peter that his parents are bad people.At school, Brian, a bully, destroys Peter's prize pumpkin. Spurred on by Sarah's advice, Peter pushes Brian down the stairs, breaking his leg. After being expelled from school, Peter's parents punish him by locking Peter in the basement, concealed behind a refrigerator. Inside the basement, Peter discovers a pit covered with a grate.Devine visits to check up on Peter, but is chased away and intimidated by Mark, who has a gash on his arm that he claims is from doing remodeling work on the house. Eventually, Peter is let out of the basement and reconnects with Sarah, who claims that she is Peter's older sister, having been locked away by their parents after deciding that they didn't want her anymore. Sarah convinces Peter that his parents are planning to kill her and that they will imprison him in the walls. His only chance, to avoid sharing her fate, is to kill his parents, which he does by slipping rat poison into their soup at dinner. Both parents try to stop him, but they succumb to the poisoning before they manage to do so, with Carol warning him to "not let her out".Peter unlocks another hidden door, located behind the grandfather clock in the parent's bedroom. Sarah crawls out, although it is dark she does not seem human. Sarah reveals to Peter that she has been deceiving and manipulating him into exacting revenge on his parents for locking her away, and that she resents Peter for being able to live a normal life. Brian and his cousins then show up at the house, planning to get revenge on Peter, but they are all killed by Sarah. Devine also shows up, summoned to the house by a phone call from Peter, and the two of them manage to imprison Sarah back in the pit of the basement, but Sarah warns Peter that she will eventually escape, and that she will always haunt him.</p>

                            <p>Description: This version of Cyrano's tale in the form of political satire follows "El Griego" ("The Greek"), a down-on-his-luck retired political image consultant, now divorced and with a young son. He often boasts of having worked for candidates who they never lost an election. Despite his unattractive appearance and past, he possesses incredible persuasive abilities thanks to his mastery of argumentation. Ricardo Prat, a charismatic but intellectually limited candidate, hires him when Camila Hewel, a former university student of "El Griego" now turned into a combative journalist, decides to confront him to expose her troubled past and his family's shady dealings. Obsessed with completing a stamp collection and full of debts, he has no choice but to come out of retirement to save Prat's campaign, to whom he dictates every one of his public (and even private) sentences as if he were a mere puppet. Thanks to "El Griego", the candidate begins to behave and speak in a way that makes the journalist fall in love with him, without being aware that every action and word comes from the mind and heart of someone who secretly loves her.—exe_malaga93</p>

                            <p>Description: Tales from the Occult 2 is a sequel to the 3-part omnibus and is a more ambitious work than its predecessor, swaying towards the psychological thriller genre. Frank Hui's Rapunzel tells the story, which begins when a female model, sexually harassed by a record company CEO, visits a hair salon where a psychopath works. Daniel Chan's Cheshire Cat is a nightmarish urban legend that slowly unveils the person who killed Nora's cat, Bobo, as the trauma continues to haunt her. Doris Wong's Tooth Fairy details the horrors that any person can experience at a dental clinic. Karena Lam who starred in Leslie Cheung's last film, Inner Senses (2002), gives a memorable performance as the mysterious dental clinic nurse.</p>

Countess Irma finds her in an aristocratic women-only commune in Greece, a whole universe away from the strict etiquette of Austria-Hungary's court. Sisi lives in absolute freedom, in which neither her children nor her husband Emperor Franz Joseph play any sort of role. The only important thing is that no one should ever be bored and that the empress herself decides the rules of the game. Irma is captivated by the charismatic Sisi and her modern ideas. But the outside world is reaching out to break Sisi. And no matter how much Irma and Sisi resist, in the end they are left with only one fatal path that will bind the two women together forever.</p>

                            <p>Description: Betrayal tells the story of the German-Dutch Ludwig Mengelberg, an officer in the German army who holds the nickname of 'Der Fliegende Holländer'. Mengelberg finds it increasingly difficult to cope with the horrors of the war and when his wife and daughter are killed in a bombing, he makes a drastic decision. When he is transferred to the Netherlands, he decides to help a Dutch farm family covering up people in hiding. In doing so, he commits high treason against his own men. When the SS becomes suspicious and the resistance advances, Mengelberg not only puts his own life in danger, but also those of the people he aims to help.—DFW International</p>

                            <p>Description: In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Roberto, a poor father of two, is approached by a former beauty queen, Gisselle. Gisselle offers to sign his young children, Miguel and Rocío, to child modeling contracts. He accepts and takes them to the photoshoot. However, when he returns to pick his children up, they are gone. It is revealed that the children were sold to be used as sex slaves.In Calexico, California, Tim Ballard is a Special Agent for the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where he arrests people who possess and distribute child pornography. The painful work takes a great toll on his personal life, and this is only worsened when another agent, Chris, points out that they have arrested many child predators, but have failed to save even a single child from being exploited. Tim explains that this is because most of them are in other countries, but Chris's words stick with him. He speaks to a predator he arrested, Ernst Oshinsky, and pretends to be a pedophile himself. Once he gains Ohinsky's trust, he sets up a meeting with a trafficked child, and is able to arrest the man who purchased the boy, Earl Buchanan.Tim rescues the boy, who says his name is Miguel. Tim befriends the child and asks him for information, hoping to find the other children. Tim learns that Miguel's sister is still missing, and the boy asks him to save her. Tim arranges for Roberto to get his son back, and Roberto breaks down because his daughter is still missing. Miguel and Roberto go home, but not before Miguel gives Tim his sister's Saint Timothy necklace. Tim starts looking for Rocío, and his search leads him to Cartagena, Colombia. He meets with former Cartel accountant, Vampiro, who now works to save children from sex trafficking.After reading about a child sex club in Thailand that was shut down, Tim decides that this is the perfect cover story to acquire a large number of Gisselle's children in a sting operation. Vampiro gets a Colombian police officer, Jorge, and a wealthy citizen named Paul to help with Tim's mission. Tim's HSI supervisor, Frost, is unable to provide funding for the operation, and asks him to return. Tim, unwilling to abandon the search for Rocío, resigns. However, Frost is eventually able to convince the Colombian U.S. Embassy to assist with Tim's rescue operation. Undercover, they convince Gisselle to sell them 54 children, successfully arrest all of the conspirators and free the children. However, Rocío is not with them.After interrogating one of Gisselle's associates, Jorge learns that Rocío was sold as a slave to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, entrenched deep in the Amazon natural region behind enemy territory. Jorge informs Tim that there is no way to retrieve the girl, because the region is largely unmapped jungle wilderness, and any rebel territory is a no-fly zone for the Colombian government. However, Vampiro suggests that doctors can get into the region for medical purposes, which gives Tim the idea to pose as doctors. Jorge reluctantly agrees to the risky operation. Tim and Vampiro attempt to enter enemy territory in disguise, but the rebels refuse to let both of them enter, leaving Tim to complete the mission alone.Tim successfully gains access to the enemy camp where Rocío is being held. He learns that she is being used as the personal sex slave for the rebel leader, El Alacrán ("the scorpion"), and is also being forced to mash coca leaves to produce cocaine to fund the rebel war against the Colombian government. Tim manages to save Rocío, but is forced to kill El Alacrán in the process. Despite being shot at by the rebels, Tim narrowly manages to save Rocío and gives her the necklace Miguel gave him earlier. Rocío is finally returned her to her father and brother, and the family returns to Honduras.An epilogue reveals that Tim Ballard never returned to his career in federal law enforcement. He credits his wife with inspiring him to create Operation Underground Railroad, which continues to save children from sexual slavery to this day, and has convinced the United States Congress to pass laws that require the government to cooperate with foreign countries on sex trafficking investigations. The epilogue also states that there are more people enslaved today than in any other time in history, including when slavery was legal. Many of these slaves are children, and the United States is one of the top consumers of child sex slaves.</p>

                            <p>Description: Based on the online phenomenon of the same name, ELEVATOR GAME follows socially awkward teenager Ryan, who ingratiates himself into a group of recent high school graduates that run an online web series debunking urban legends. But Ryan has a secret: His sister disappeared months earlier, and he believes they - and a dangerous online challenge called 'The Elevator Game' - were responsible. To play the game, you must ride the elevator in a specific sequence, invoking a supernatural creature called 'The 5th Floor Woman'. In an attempt to gain more information as to the whereabouts of his sister, Ryan persuades the group to play the game once more, and risk unleashing the most fearsome consequences imaginable.—Fearworks</p>

                            <p>Description: Christmas used to be Chicago-based Addison Dean's favorite time of the year, but that quickly changed in working in Christmas branding activities twelve months out of the year. So instead of going home to the small town of Red Lake Falls to spend Christmas with her Christmas fanatical family in the Christmas fanatical town, she has for the last several years gone to the Maldives for the holidays to escape Christmas. This year, however, her brother Connor Dean convinces her as the only person he tells beforehand to go home to help him celebrate proposing to his girlfriend Sienna on Christmas Eve, the two having met at the town's Christmas Festival on a Christmas Eve when she first moved to town. Addy still intends to head off to the Maldives on the 26th, which will allow her also to spend the big day of her town councilor father Nick Dean's Christmas charity, Operation Christmas Smile, with him, it being Christmas Day itself. Feeling overwhelmed by everything Christmas with her family, Addy wishes for Christmas to just go away. Her wish is not only miraculously granted in no one but her even remembering what Christmas is, but that everything has turned to black and white in rather sad shades of gray. In returning a military service ring her somewhat surly mechanic Hunter Blakeman accidentally left in her car, it which was a Christmas gift from his now deceased grandfather when Hunter joined the service himself, he becomes the first person to remember a happy memory of Christmas in his return to color. He admits that he only recently moved to Red Lake Falls to take over the garage from said grandfather and to hide from the world and Christmas, the ring which provided him as a memory of what Christmas means. As Addy and Hunter start to fall for each other, they believe the key to getting people to change back to bright and happy color is to make them remember the happiness of Christmas in their lives. However, Addy, in helping others remember, may face the biggest challenge in remembering herself in long ago having lost the spirit of Christmas despite her work.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: From multi-award-winning sports documentary specialists Noah Media Group comes this definitive portrait of a unique, working-class hero and one of the world's most beloved boxers - Ricky 'The Hitman' Hatton. The documentary, with incredible access to Ricky and unseen archive footage, charts his journey from the Hattersley estate near Manchester to headlining on the strip in Las Vegas is an emotional insight into a brilliant sporting hero.Earmarked for greatness from the moment he turned professional, Ricky quickly rose to the pinnacle of his sport. Adored by the public, he was a raging force in the ring, but the eventual pain of defeat would become utterly unbearable. Triumph, and pride were replaced by depression, addiction, and shame. His courage was clear, but it hid a darkness that would overwhelm him.Crucially, his relationships with those closest to him fell apart. A near decade estrangement from his family and split from his coach pushed Ricky to his absolute rock bottom and an attempted suicide. Raw and compelling, the documentary showcases this cautionary tale and inspirational story of a man forced to navigate a path through fragile relationships and broken dreams as he attempts to make sense of a life that appeared destined for a happy ending.Ricky Hatton is directed by multi-award winning Dan Dewsbury and produced by Noah Media Group (14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible, Finding Jack Charlton), in association with Sky Studios.

                            <p>Description: In the first step in working what for her are the coveted international flights, pilot Kate Gabriel is on her first probational flight working for Thomas and Helen Sharpe, who have their own home furnishings empire. One of the factors for them hiring her is her flexibility in being willing to pick up at a moment's notice in she having no personal commitments such as family. This flight on December 20th is from Los Angeles to Switzerland where the Sharpes and thus Kate will be spending the holidays, in addition to the Sharpes conducting some business in wanting to expand their brand into the European market. The flight doesn't end up as Kate hopes as a storm over the Atlantic grounds all transatlantic flights, the only airport where she can land being in a small coastal Nova Scotia community called Christmas Island. With it being the busy Christmas season, Kate and the Sharpes end up being hosted by the town's mayor Maggie Hughes and her family which also includes her father, the town's postmaster Jim McLeod, and her brother, air traffic controller Oliver McLeod, Oliver and Kate who had some choice words for each other in the flight being grounded. The duration of the grounding is unknown. Wanting to make a good impression on the Sharpes, Kate, who has nothing to do but wait out the storm along with everyone else, offers to help them with whatever they require while they are in Christmas Island. While Thomas and Helen try to do work in their stranding, what Helen requests of Kate a job usually handled by hired help, namely finding Christmas activities the Sharpes' two children: fifteen year old Cali who is at the stage of her life of not liking anything about their family, and seven year old Finn who instead wishes for more of a Christmas with his family than they have had recently. This task is not the easiest for Kate in not being a Christmas person and having no family of her own. As such, she feels she has to enlist the help of the town's resident Christmas expert: Oliver. Their collective time together will either drive them crazy or bring them back together under the magic of Christmas, which for Oliver and Kate becomes more important personally as they start to fall for each other, with their Christmas spirit affected by whether they can make it to Switzerland by the 25th.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: In the small town of Vernon, on October 27, 29, and 31, 1987, three teenage girls named Tiffany Clark, Marisa Song, and Heather Hernandez were respectively killed by the Sweet 16 Killer, each having been stabbed 16 times on the nights of their 16th birthdays.In the present day, teenager Jamie Hughes goes to a concert with her friend Amelia on Halloween night while her mother, Pam, stays at home. Pam used to be friends with the three victims of the Sweet 16 Killer, and while handing out candy, she is attacked by the killer, who stabs her to death. As Jamie grieves Pam's death, she helps Amelia put the finishing touches on a time machine she created for a school project and is approached by reporter Chris Dubasage, who tells her that Pam received a note from the killer that she kept secret: "You're next, one day."At night, Jamie is chased by the killer and hides in the time machine, which activates and sends her back to 1987. She realizes that if she stops the Sweet 16 Killer's original spree, she can save Pam's life. Jamie, masquerading as an exchange student from Canada, discovers that Pam and her friends were despised by everyone in the town as they were bullies. Jamie manages to convince Amelia's mother, Lauren, and a teenager named Doug, her school's present-day principal, to help her. Although Jamie manages to infiltrate a party hosted by Tiffany, she is unable to stop her murder. Using the trauma to bond with Pam, she infiltrates their group and convinces them to leave for the weekend, although this backfires; they end up at the cabin where Marisa was killed in the original timeline. As Jamie works to protect Marisa, Heather is murdered instead, changing the timeline.On Halloween night, the group reconvenes at the amusement park while Lauren works on turning a popular attraction into a makeshift time machine for Jamie to travel forward. In the present, Chris helps Amelia fix their time machine as they realize the timeline is changing. The group lures the Sweet 16 Killer into a haunted house where he attacks them, only to be impaled by Kara, the town sheriff in the present, with a scythe. Doug is revealed as the killer, seeking revenge on the group for the death of his girlfriend Trish. Marisa reveals that she, Tiffany, and Heather got Trish drunk one night and let her drive home, with her dying in an accident; Pam, however, was not present. As Jamie wonders why Pam received the note, a second killer appears and slits Marisa's throat.The second killer chases after Jamie, killing Chris' father along the way. The two face off in the new time machine as it activates and the killer is revealed to be Chris from the present. Doug was the original killer, but Chris murdered Pam and forged the note in order to generate more content for his podcast. The two fight and Jamie kicks him into the spinning machine, killing him. Upon returning to the present day, she finds that Pam is still alive. Since Jamie's parents got together earlier than they had originally, she now has an older brother named Jamie and her name is now Colette.</p>

                            <p>Description: After graduating in the law school, Jaime Reyes returns to Palmera City to meet his family, and soon he learns that they are broken and evicted from their home. His sister Milagro gets a cleaning job for him at the mansion of the wealthy Victoria Kord. However, they are both fired by Susan when Jaime interferes in a discussion between Victoria and her niece Jenny Kord. When Jaime is leaving the house, Jenny asks him to look for her in the Kord Tower for a job opportunity. On the next morning, Jenny learns that her aunt is using an ancient alien Scarab to develop powerful weapons and she steals the artifact. Meanwhile, Jaime is looking for her to get a job, and she uses him to leave the Tower with the scarab hidden in a burger to-go box. His curious Mexican family opens the box and Jaime becomes the host of the alien scarab and they fuse in a powerful weapon. Jaime looks for Jenny to have explanations but he turns into the Blue Beetle. She tells him that they have to remove the device as soon as possible; otherwise, the fusion will be permanent.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p>

Sri's daily life is spent working for Yu Minah. However, the income from her job is not enough to cover the cost of living or her father's medication. A new opportunity finally comes when the Atmodjo family offers Sri a job with a high salary. Sri is asked to work for the Atmodjo family because she was born on a Friday Kliwon. However, the reason is suspicious, as is the type of job which remains a mystery. Nevertheless, Sri accepts the offer due to her difficult situation. She is recruited to work with two other women, Erna and Dini. They are taken to a hidden hut in the middle of the forest, where they are assigned to bathe Della Atmodjo, the granddaughter of Karsa Atmodjo. Della has been unconscious for a considerable amount of time due to the "kutukan sewu dino" or a thousand-day curse. This makes the three realize that the Atmodjo family has trapped them. Sri soon realizes that Erna and Dini were also born on Friday Kliwon. The situation becomes even more complicated as they have to take care of Della, who is confined in a coffin. Sri, Dini, and Ema then face various mystical terrors while staying at the house. They also discover that they are involved in a mystical agreement. Their lives are even threatened if they dare to escape before the agreement ends on the 1,000th day.</p>

                            <p>Description: An unnamed young girl (Nora Woolsey) watches an old television programme via a projector and laptop in a theatre. 'Ghosts Of Hollywood Past' is a cheap, late night supernatural TV series presented by Psychic Investigator Dale Torrance (Al Carretta) and his actress co-host Taryn Spring (Freya Parsons). Eating chocolate and crisps, the girl is enamoured with the show that details Taryn and Dale's kidnapping and the retelling of stories associated with Jean Harlow and the disappearance of the actress who portrayed her on Dale's show.As partial credits begin to roll, Dale Torrance addresses his research team via webcam. Dale is clearly a few years older than he was in the television show excerpts and tells his online audience to scrutinise every word his subject says. The young girl appears on a television screen in an interview format and begins to make key statements about her life. The researchers; Sam Ford (Cameron Vince) and July (Emma De Ouse), consume and dissect every word as Dale determines the core facts; the girl was abducted at age three and has led a complex life ever since.Over a zooming map, the credit sequence rolls to indicate the girl has spent her life on the move around Europe from a start point in the South coast of England in 2007. As the credits close, a title card indicates '16 years later' and the girl begins a one on one interview with Dale that pulls the situation into focus. The girl presents memory cards with a diary and pictures, details her former nicknames and explains the abuse she suffered before the age of ten, including a paramount detail; her eye was cut out by her captors before she was six, she has a glass eye but has hidden the injury behind swept hair.With Dale having established the validity of the girl's claims from the memory cards presented in the first interview, his producer, Holly March (Charlotte Reidie) settles the girl at a hotel in Camden pending more rehearsal interviews and scrutiny. From here, Holly details how the next few days will unfold. Ultimately, the girl will be presented before a live TV audience if her claims are verified. Dale and the researchers continue their detailed interview with the girl. Doctor Hal (Sean O'Grady), a psychologist, asserts his professional observations and in review, Dale reminds everyone via a webcall that the girl is only to be called 'Presence' even though they know her real name.As planned by Holly, Dale and Presence go to a park that might have been her childhood favourite. The highly intelligent Presence knows instantly that they have taken her to the wrong park deliberately. Learning of the developments, the potential Mother (Zara Hadeshian) of Presence gets in touch, eager to know what is happening. Dale explains everything he knows and invites her to an interview where he will present the case and potentially introduce her to Presence. As the researchers prepare for the Mother's arrival, Presence offers up another memory card with more pictures. Holly meets with Presence again knowing that the meeting hinges on what Rick (Paul Kelleher), the former FBI data analyst thinks of the case. Meeting with Dale, Rick explains that he is blown away by the consistency of the evidence presented and identifies the scenarios that lock down the likely truth of the situation. Presence, growing in confidence, unashamedly acknowledges to Holly she chose Dale over other journalists because she watched his TV show in Poland and knew he would listen to her.Not impressed by this, Holly takes a stern approach with Presence who reveals that she knows something that would be of great interest to Dale. Pushing her to reveal what, Presence explains that her Polish mother's friend was the actress who played 'Jean Harlow' in Dale's show but disappeared after undergoing heavy plastic surgery. Holly understands the significance of this information in relation to Dale's actual kidnapping years previously but can't alert Dale in time as the interview with the Mother is about to begin.Dale presents the case of Presence to the Mother and talks her through the evidence, which includes photographs of her family and her husband at the time of the disappearance. Stating that he doesn't believe the girl to be her missing daughter, Dale also acknowledges that truth is stranger than fiction. Drawing a quick conclusion to the emotionally charged meeting, Dale asks the Mother to answer one key question. With most elements aligned, Dale exits the interview to question Presence who gives identical answers and reasoning as the mother. After an awkward pause, the red studio curtains are drawn back for Presence to come face to face with her Mother.</p>

                            <p>Description: The morning after hearing gunshots in nearby woods, brothers Pedro and Jaime investigate and discover half the body of a man which leads them to a nearby shack, where a woman hides with her two sons. The oldest son, Uriel, has become a "Rotten" - a being possessed by an unborn demon who is awaiting physical birth. The deceased man in the woods is a "Cleaner" that the mother called for a year prior, someone who is supposed to safely kill Uriel and abort the demon before it possesses others.After authorities dismiss the Rotten as not their problem, the brothers approach the landowner Ruiz who aggressively attempts to deal with Uriel himself by disposing of the blighted Uriel, dumping him hours away. After narrowly avoiding a young boy in the road, the three men discover Uriel has somehow escaped the truck. Ruiz declares the matter resolved and returns home unconcerned. The next morning, Ruiz's wife discovers one of their goats has become possessed. Against her warning not to use guns because they help to spread the possession of the Rotted, Ruiz executes the animal and his wife promptly commits murder-suicide with an axe.The next morning, Jaime and Pedro agree to leave the town, take their family members, and escape to safety. Jaime gets their mother, while Pedro goes to the home of his ex-wife, Sabrina. This leads to an argument between himself, Sabrina and her new husband, Leonardo, when Pedro tries to collect his two children. While they are distracted by the argument, the family dog who, previously licked Pedro's demon-mucked clothes, savagely attacks Leonardo and Sabrina's daughter and drags her outside. Leonardo and Pedro chase the dog and the former shoots the dog. Pedro returns to Sabrina but sees her daughter is back unharmed and threatening Sabrina, so Pedro steals their car. As Pedro drives away with his sons, he witnesses Leonardo crash his car into Sabrina as their daughter dances.After Pedro picks up Jaime and their mother, the assembled family leaves town and arrives at the house of Mirta, a former Cleaner and friend of Jaime, who invites them to stay overnight. Mirta warns Jaime about Pedro's autistic son as exhibiting signs of possession which Jaime dismisses. The possessed corpse of Sabrina kidnaps her youngest son and Mirta advises that Jaime chase after her while she and Pedro search for Uriel to end the demonic plague. While seeking out Sabrina, Jaime discovers she has killed the child and runs her over in a fit of emotion. In doing this, he collides with a tree. Grandma stays at Mirta's house and waits with her oldest grandson who returns to the house, now speaking clearly and without impediment.Pedro and Mirta's search leads them to a schoolhouse filled with possessed children who boldly lie to the pair in order to exacerbate the demonic birth. The pair find Uriel under the stage in the small auditorium and Pedro tries to properly unearth him as Mirta sets up the demon killing equipment. Losing his patience and believing one of the children's lies about a fire axe nearby that might help, Pedro runs to the office while Mirta screams to not leave her. While he is away, the children trap Pedro, kill Mirta and dismantle the equipment. Enraged, Pedro beats Uriel to death with a piece of the broken equipment but is too late to intercept the birth. The demon inside Uriel is born soon after, shedding his corpse and presenting itself to a defeated Pedro. After taunting Pedro by sparing him, the newly born demon walks out into the morning sun followed by the children.The two brothers return to Mirta's separately and after collecting the remaining son, head back to their own home. At the shed, Uriel's possessed brother tells him he killed the original Cleaner four days ago, devouring him. He also reveals he did the same to his mother the night before and alludes that his and Pedro's mother has suffered the same fate. Pedro returns inside and feeds his son ice cream but he begins choking. While Pedro helps him, he discovers he's choking on his mother's hair and that his son is possessed as well, having tricked him under the veil of his autism. Pedro runs outside and collapses in grief, having lost everyone but his brother.</p>

                            <p>Description: The period when Hamka became a manager of Muhammadiyah in Makassar and successfully brought significant progress to the organization. Hamka also started writing literature for newspapers and his romance stories were well-liked by readers. Hamka and his family moved to Medan because he was appointed as the editor-in-chief of Pedoman Masyarakat magazine. This position caused Hamka to clash with the Japanese authorities, leading to the magazine being shut down as it was deemed dangerous. The Hamka family's life was also shaken when one of their children died due to illness.

                            <p>Description: Based on true events, Inside Man follows disgraced New York Police Detective Bobby Belucci (Emile Hirsch) as his life falls apart when he discovers his wife (Ashley Greene) is having an affair. After beating her lover to a pulp, she leaves him and Bobby gets demoted at work, triggering his determination to prove he's worthy of redemption. His plan is to go undercover as a grunt and infiltrate the Gambino crime family's notorious "DeMeo Crew," a violent and bloody faction that reigned terror in the 1960s and '70s. Bobby will stop at nothing to get close to the head of the crew, Roy DeMeo (Danny Abeckaser), to expose the murder and corruption. But as Bobby sinks deeper into the mob and more bodies drop, the price for absolution may be higher than he can afford.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lasse is a disillusioned truck driver from Jutland. He lives his life like he drives his truck straight ahead with his hand on the steering wheel and the other hand around the secret bottle. Until the instant, a young woman jumps in front of his truck. Lasse pulls the brakes at the last minute and to his surprise, he realizes that the woman is, René, who he hasn't seen in 15 years. A journey begins that afternoon that will turn their lives upside down as they get the chance to restore a family while trying to abandon the hope of starting a new one.—Charlotte Madsen</p>

His absence causes the family to fear that he will never return, while the mother's health deteriorates. Desperate for help, the family's young daughter Tala turns to a deceitful and flesh-eating fairy, who plans to devour them all.</p>

                            <p>Description: On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. The following day, the Wang False Government followed Japan's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, and Japan symbolically occupied all of Shanghai. With the outbreak of the Pacific War, the situation of China's war effort changed completely. Members of the Chinese Communist Party underground risked sending out information to break the peace between Japan and Chiang and to defend the motherland.—themoviedb</p>

                            <p>Description: The story begins when Samuel is found dead in the snow outside the isolated chalet where he lived with his wife Sandra, a German writer, and their partially-sighted 11-year-old son Daniel. An investigation leads to a conclusion of "suspicious death": it's impossible to know for sure whether he took his own life or was killed. Sandra is indicted, and we follow her trial which pulls the couple's relationship apart. Daniel is caught in the middle: between the trial and their home life, doubts take their toll on the mother-son relationship.—Cineuropa</p>

                            <p>Description: Chris and Veronica have been together since they were in high school... when she leaves him for a job in California, he's heartbroken and can't get over her. When his best friend crafts a time machine, he tries it out to see if it'll work. Going back to the day of their breakup via a nuclear powered FitBit, Chris tries to stop her leaving but winds up having to confront the consequences upon his arrival back to the present. Unable to let her go, he'll go back again... and again... and again... and again some more, trying to make things right (and discovering the flaws in their relationship along the way).—Scott Sawitz</p>

Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Danny, a marketing manager for the Nissan automobile corporation, is running an advertising campaign and, together with the management of Gran Turismo, hatches a plan to launch a competition inviting gamers to try their luck in real racing cars.

Immerse yourself in the most electrifying cinematic experience of the year with "Meg 2: The Trench" - where the depths of the ocean are matched only by the heights of sheer, unstoppable excitement.—Warner Bros.

                            <p>Description: Deep in the heart of Dixie, in a small town struggling with the ravages of addiction, a local sheriff (John Travolta) tries to maintain the peace when desperate family man Shelby (Shiloh Fernandez) robs a pill mill with his reckless brother-in-law, Trey (Kevin Dillon). But the supposedly easy score takes a violent turn, alerting the New Orleans mafia's revenge-seeking enforcer (Stephen Dorff), who threatens Shelby's wife (Ashley Benson) and daughter. With its unpredictable twists and turns, Mob Land is a heart-pounding, action thriller.—Saban Films</p>

                            <p>Description: Stacy Friedman is a girl who dreams about her upcoming bat mitzvah, including sharing the moment with her BFF Lydia Rodriguez Katz and sharing a dance with her crush Andy Goldfarb. She clashes with her parents Bree and Danny about having a "perfect" party, which she feels will set her up for her future, and gets support from her big sister Ronnie.When Lydia is invited to popular girl Kym Chang Cohen's house, Stacy tags along. The girls all go out to a high ledge, where Andy and his friends meet up with them. On a dare, and to impress Andy, Stacy agrees to jump off the ledge into the water below. Her happiness at getting Andy and everyone else's approval is short-lived when her bloody maxi-pad floats up next to her. Angry at Andy laughing at her and seeing Lydia laughing with the group, Stacy decides to "call it", having Lydia announce the time when her crush on Andy "died".Once school starts again, Stacy soon finds that Lydia and Andy are going out with each other. Feeling betrayed, Stacy stops talking to her. She sends a text message to an anonymous group that Lydia has hair on her nipples. Stacy even goes so far as to sabotage an "entrance video" she was making for Lydia's upcoming bat mitzvah with humiliating personal video clips. However, she does not send it.Stacy continues to try getting Andy's attention, also visiting Andy's grandmother's retirement home. She also tries make to herself look older and more popular than she is, arguing with her parents over attractions to have at her bat mitzvah and what clothes she may wear. Andy eventually offers to give Stacy her first kiss. Hiding behind the curtains of a Torah ark, they are interrupted by their teacher Rabbi Rebecca. This leads to more fighting between her and Danny.Lydia's mother Gabi, who does not know that Stacy and Lydia are fighting, comes over to the Friedmans'. She asks Bree for the entrance video for Lydia's bat mitzvah. Not realizing what is in it, Bree sends it to her. On the day of Lydia's bat mitzvah, the entrance video is played by DJ Schmuley. Although Stacy tries to get him to stop the video, the damage is done - when Lydia is about to walk into her party, she runs off and angrily tells Stacy off.When Stacy's bat mitzvah day comes, she goes up to read from the Torah from her parsha of Ki Tissa. Seeing Lydia and her parents not there, she stops and confesses everything to the gathered audience, and tells off Andy for being horrible and driving her and Lydia apart. After her confession, she finishes her Torah reading at Danny's urging.Afterwards, Stacy runs off to apologize to Lydia and asks her to come to her party later that night. When Lydia and her parents come, they are surprised to see that the party has been changed to be a new party for both Lydia and Stacy. The girls make up with each other, while Stacy starts dancing with Mateo, a different boy at her school who had often sought Stacy's attention.Sometime later, Stacy, Lydia, and their friends have a bake sale to help the retirement home.</p>

                            <p>Description: Dumb Money is the ultimate David vs. Goliath tale, based on the insane true story of everyday people who flipped the script on Wall Street and got rich by turning GameStop (the video game store) into the world's hottest company. In the middle of everything is regular guy Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who starts it all by sinking his life savings into the stock and posting about it. When his social posts start blowing up, so does his life and the lives of everyone following him.

                            <p>Description: In 1966 southern California, Richard Montañez grows up as a hard-working child with a strict father and supportive grandfather. He meets his future wife Judy in school where he begins selling burritos to other children. He is arrested at a young age when nobody believed that he made his money this way. As an adult, Richard and Judy live their lives as hoodlums selling drugs but turn their life around once Judy gets pregnant with their first child. A second child later, Richard and his family begin struggling trying to make ends meet as he searches for work. He eventually turns to his friend, and fellow former hoodlum, Tony Romero, who helps him get a job at Frito-Lay. Despite lying on his resumé, floor head Lonny Mason hires him. Richard begins paying attention to all the nuances of the factory and starts pursuing engineer maintenance leader Clarence C. Baker to help with teaching him about the machines. Despite some reluctance, Baker agrees and teaches Richard how to operate all the machinery in the factory. Unfortunately, the Reagan administration begins to severely affect low level paying jobs and Frito-Lay's stocks begin to go down. This eventually results in some of the workers getting laid off. Frito-Lay CEO Roger Enrico puts a video out to the workers which is viewed by Richard and gets the inspiration to "think like a CEO". After picking up his kids from school, Richard takes them out for elotes (Mexican street corn). Upon noticing that his youngest son Steven likes the spicy flavor, despite it bothering him, he realizes that the way to save Frito-Lay is to pitch to the Latino market. He convinces Baker and the rest of his coworkers to let him take some unflavored Cheetos home, but Judy offers that he talks to his father Vacho first about a job. Vacho ends up belittling Richard's plans, causing Judy to support Richard even more. The Montañezes work tirelessly trying to find the perfect spicy flavor for Cheetos, eventually getting the right concoction. Richard attempts to pitch his idea to Lonny, but he turns him down, forcing him to sneak in and copy Enrico's phone number. Richard manages to get through to Enrico who, while perplexed over being called by a janitor, is intrigued to learn that he saw his video and asks that he send his flavored Cheetos. He tastes them and is immediately hooked, setting up a meeting at the factory right away. While Lonny is upset with Richard, he prepares himself for the pitch, finally getting the approval of his father to back him up. Richard proceeds to speak from the heart and his pitch his accepted with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos being put into production. While this results in more jobs, the new flavor is not flying off the shelves. Disappointed, Richard's children point out that there is no advertisements for the flavor. Richard returns to work and orders everyone to use their skills to sell the new flavor straight from the street. The tactic works and Enrico calls to ask that the factory produce an even bigger order. While Baker gets the promotion, he always desired, Richard is still a janitor, though Baker gives him some support. Lonny asks Richard to clean upstairs, only to find Enrico who tells him that he understands his struggles growing up, before revealing that he has been promoted to head of international marketing. Richard is applauded by all his coworkers for his success, and he happily calls Judy to tell her the good news. The end titles reveal that Richard retired from the company after 45 years and that he and Judy are still together.</p>

Both of them wander directionless along the village road, then an old truck pulls in front of them and a gentleman, AHMAD, 58, a tombstone maker exits the vehicle. It is clear to AHMAD that AH YOKE is escaping from the devilish hands of her abusive husband. Without hesitation, he helps both of them into his vehicle and drives home. AHMAD introduces his wife, KHATIJAH, 53, and son, AZMAN, 15, to both of them. The family offers them a shelter, to ease their miserable state for as long as they want. Soon, the short bonding of both families of various beliefs gradually strengthens into a strong relationship. After enrolling into the same school and the support Azman offers XIAO LI, their friendship begins to flourish into a simple love story. AH YOKE soon finds out and harshly disagrees to it, despite things AHMAD's family has been providing for them. The situation complicates further as KHATIJAH is diagnosed with final stage cancer. Seeing such conflicts between the interracial relationships, KHATIJAH insists on her deathbed that both Azman and XIAO LI begins a journey in designing and crafting her tombstone. The fate of their love story, dramatic clashes of conflicts between each characters are resolved by the most fundamental elements of all, 'Love'.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1941, Hong Kong is the Eastern Fortress of the British Empire. With the sudden attack by Japanese forces, three intertwined stories unravel against the backdrop of a collapsing city. First, the story of two Chinese sisters, one who works as a courtesan, the other inside British military headquarters known as the Battlebox, become swept up in a botched spy operation. Second, a tight band of Rajput soldiers on the Gin Drinkers Line becomes trapped in a Japanese ambush, requiring an act of bravery to save the others. Third, an unnerving fog-of-war descends upon Major-General Maltby and his top officers as they struggle with the decision to either fight to the death or offer a humiliating surrender of the British Colony.—McCourry Films</p>

                            <p>Description: Friday morning 6:30 am.An academically focused and passionate football player, Siddharth (Babil Khan) always wanted every decision he made to be perfect. The stressful decision of applying to the right colleges got to him, and his brother's sudden interest in accompanying him to an early soccer match troubled him even more.Siddharth strongly believed that his brother would only make situations worse for him. After all, it was because of Adi (Amrith Jayan) that his classmates came up with an embarrassing nickname for him (Shitty Siddy, since Sid takes too much time in the bathroom). Siddharth also knew that Adi had a hidden motive behind his sudden interest in watching his elder brother play. Siddharth had always watched the matches from the bench, and his brother coming to support him would be humiliating.
Siddharth tried to explain his situation to his mother, but it did not help his cause. Siddharth had his eyes on his mother's (Juhi Chawla) car, and now that he had a driving license, he wanted to take it out for a ride. Siddharth's mother categorically asked him not to touch the car while she was away on her business trip. They agreed to go on a weekend family trip together, during which Sid would finally get the chance to drive the car.Adi always wanted to become cool and popular in school, and he was desperately trying to find a way to get into the good books of the football players and the famous senior girls. While Sid did not approve of Adi's desperate behavior, he did take into consideration Adi's opinion about asking Natasha Sabharwal (Medha Rana) for prom. Sid had a major crush on Natasha for years, but he never dared to express his feelings. She was the popular girl in school, while he was the nerd.Sid was asked to wait on the bench before the match began. He was pretty much lost in his own romantic thoughts when Own Goal (the nickname of the player) injured his leg and was pulled out of the match. The coach asked Sid to join, and his only advice for Sid was to pass the ball to the star football player, Kabir (Aditya Jain). After waiting on the bench for years, Sid finally got the chance to prove himself as a footballer. When the ball was passed to him, he could either attempt to score the goal or lose the opportunity while trying to pass it to Kabir. Sid took his chance and scored. Natasha and her sister Nitya were also at the game.
While the players and students celebrated the win, Sid left the field. But as soon as he left the restroom, he found 'fans' swarming all around him.
Sid learns that Kabir is also looking to ask Natasha for the prom.Sid meets the school's counselor, who begs him to start his university application process, which he has been stalling for 8 months. Sid says that if he has to take a gap year, so be it, but he won't apply without doing proper research.To celebrate the grand win, the football team declared a Friday night party, popularly known as the FNP (Friday Night Plan). Sid initially decided not to attend the party, but his decision changed when Natasha asked him to join. Natasha wanted to go on a late-night car ride, and Sid jumped at the opportunity, promising to bring his car to the party. Natasha says that the boys are meeting at JC's before the party and says that Kabir will text him the details.
Adi was over the moon once he realized that Sid would be attending the party. Sid could not leave Adi alone at home since their mother was away, so unwillingly, he had to take Adi along.Adi helped Sid prepare for the party by introducing him to all the party games and helping him dress right for the occasion. Sid felt extremely guilty driving his mother's car, but he had no other option. He had to prove to Natasha that he was worth going to prom with, and a late-night drive could be a way to her heart. Sid and Adi met with the rest of the football team at a shady eatery. The boys from the opposing school paid the owner of the eatery to turn on the sprinklers, leaving the ISM boys soaking wet.The prank was almost a ritual that both schools engaged in, and it was time for ISM to come up with an equally embarrassing prank idea. Adi stepped in and suggested they throw eggs at the opposing players. Sid was behind the wheel while the rest of the boys attacked the Global School boys with eggs. Unfortunately, instead of hitting a player, one of the eggs Adi threw landed on a police officer. As apologetic as Sid was about the incident, he could not afford to stay back and sort out the matter. The car belonged to his mother, and he could not land in trouble. But the police officer was not ready to let go of them. His ego was hurt, and he decided to teach the boys a lesson. He followed the car, and once Sid and Adi left it parked on the side of the road, he towed it after he found eggs inside the car. Sid and Adi ask Kabir to come pick them up for the party.After reaching the party, Sid decided to go back to the location where he left the car with Kabir's car and his driver. As soon as he reached it, he realized that the car had been towed. Sid called Adi for support, but as usual, his younger brother was not worried at all. Adi's logic was simple: since they could not deal with the car issue, it was better to party. He advised Sid to inform their mother the next morning and leave it to her to deal with the police. Sid was guilt-tripping, and after disconnecting Adi's call, he dialed his mother's number. He had broken her trust, and he sought comfort in her voice. Meanwhile, Adi continued to portray his brother as an action-hero figure who not only scored a goal in the morning but was also a smooth driver who maneuvered through the Mumbai alleys and helped them complete the prank.Unable to make a decision, Sid arrived at the party. He confronted Adi and accused him of being a coward who always created trouble but did not have the guts to face any consequences. Adi tried to stay calm, but he was not ready to accept all the accusations. He retorted and accused Sid of being timid and always hiding behind his problems.
Sid enjoyed dancing, but he never dared to shake a leg in public. Adi reminded Sid how he had failed to send a single college application simply because he lacked clarity. He was so hesitant about making the wrong decision that he chose not to even try.Adi believed that Sid changed after the death of their father. He wanted to become responsible and dependable, but in the process, he forgot to enjoy his life in the first place. Sid agreed that he could not bear the thought of disappointing their mother, and he challenged Adi to call their mother and confess the truth. Adi pretended to call her and convinced Sid that their mother was busy, and she said that she would take care of the mess after she returned home.
Sid was relieved, and he finally decided to enjoy the night. Adi did what he thought was best for his brother. He knew that they would not be able to solve the problem that night, but Sid could have the most memorable night and enjoy his last few days in school.Everyone at the party welcomed Sid with open arms. He was having the time of his life, playing party games and dancing with his crush. Adi's best friend, Nitya (Aadhya Anand), had overheard Sid and Adi's argument, and later, when Sid came up to her to talk, she explained how Adi had no ill-intentions for him. Sid realized he might have been too harsh on Adi, and they made up, singing and dancing to a song that they had composed. But Sid did not know then that Adi had called their mother in the meantime. Adi was feeling guilty after his confrontation with Sid. He wondered if he truly was a disappointment to their mother, and he called her for comfort. After receiving calls from both her sons, she figured out that something was going on. Her meeting had ended, and she decided to return home.Before Sid learned about the truth, he got a chance to spend some time alone with Natasha. He expressed how well he related to the poetry she had penned for English class, and Natasha explained that it was her sister, Nitya, who had composed it. Sid realized that he barely knew Natasha, and the bit he fell in love with was not really her. While Natasha showed interest in him, Sid made it clear that he did not wish to pursue a relationship that he did not see any potential in. After his honest conversation with Natasha, Sid apologized to Adi. As soon as the brothers united, Adi confessed that their mother was on her way back home.The plan was to somehow convince the police officer to allow them to take their car home. After reaching the police station, Sid begged the sub-inspector, Suhas Pingale (Ninad Kamat), to forgive their childish mistake, and he was about to offer him money when Adi came to his rescue. Adi realized that the sub-inspector would be offended if he was offered money, and so he interrupted Sid and confessed that he was the one who flung an egg at him. After apologizing and appreciating the policeman for being an honest cop, Suhas Pingale allowed them to leave the station with their car.The brothers drove back home, and before their mother arrived, they managed to sort everything out on their own. As soon as their mother entered the house, she asked them to explain the phone calls, and the brothers decided to confess the truth. After overcoming what seemed impossibly stressful, they realized they could laugh about it with their mother.
The two brothers became closer than ever before. Not only that, Sid realized that he barely knew the girl he had a crush on and could instead relate more to her sister, Nitya.
Sid was the famous kid in school with a prom date and a newfound confidence to take the risk and apply to colleges.</p>

                            <p>Description: The film opens with a young Robert Nesta Marley (Nolan Collignon) joining his mother as they take a bus from one home to another. This is followed by text explaining how Bob Marley is still known today as Jamaica's biggest star. He grew up from humble beginnings around a time of violence in Jamaica during the 70s after the nation gained its independence from Great Britain.Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), already well into his career, goes to a press conference after announcing that he is planning to hold a peace concert, "Smile Jamaica", to unite the nation in the face of political discourse. Some critics fear that Bob is making it look like his is taking a side.Kingston, 1976 - Bob is playing soccer with his friends and sons when thugs start firing their guns in the streets. Bob protects his sons and takes them away, telling them not to worry about what happened (this is also where he starts to come up with "Three Little Birds"). They return to their home, where Bob talks to his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch), as the constant threat of violence around their family puts her on edge.Later, Bob goes to rehearse "I Shot The Sheriff" with his group, The Wailers. Rita steps out momentarily and sees two gunmen running towards the house, while a third aims his gun at her head. The two men enter the house and shoot at Bob and his friend Don Taylor (Anthony Welsh), while Rita has also been shot. Despite his injury, Bob rises to his feet and gets Don and Rita to the hospital. Bob sits by Rita's bedside as she lies unconscious. He reminisces about when they were teenagers (played by Quan-Dajai Henrique and Nia Ashi) and Bob began to court Rita.Following their recoveries, Bob still plans on going forward with the concert. Everyone close to him sees it as a bad idea for his safety and his family's, but he insists on doing it. On the night of the show, Bob goes and performs, but he briefly hallucinates seeing the gunman that shot him in the crowd. He then stops the show and reveals his injuries to the crowd before walking off the stage. Rita tries to comfort him, and Bob says he needs time to himself.Three months later, Bob travels to London with some of his friends. While there, they are arrested for possession of cannabis. In jail, Bob recalls how Rita first brought him into the Rastafari movement. He also thinks about witnessing his father abandon him and his mother when he was a child, and he refused to acknowledge Bob as his son.Later, Bob talks to his producer Chris Blackwell (James Norton) over ideas for a new album. Rita joins him in London while Bob and the Wailers are trying to come up with a new sound. Bob listens to the soundtrack to the film "Exodus" and starts to come up with his own song of the same name. With help from publicist Howard Bloom (Michael Gandolfini), the group makes their next album, "Exodus", which becomes a worldwide best-selling hit.Following the album's success, Bob goes on a tour throughout Europe in 1977. Although he sees much more success and popularity, Bob is seen engaging in an affair with a woman, Cindy Breakspeare (Umi Myers). During a pickup game of soccer, Bob is seen stumbling after an injury, but he brushes it off.Chris invites Bob and company to an event. While there, Bob gets jealous at seeing Rita talking to another man. When he goes outside to confront her, she in turn hits back at him with the knowledge of his own multiple affairs and the children he has produced as a result. Rita slaps Bob and also tells him to keep an eye out for Don, as he is doing some shady businesses behind Bob's back.After another show, Bob confronts Don backstage over what Rita told him. He begins to physically attack Don before his band mates and Rita pull Bob off of him.Not long after, Bob visits a doctor after Rita and Chris express concerns over a dark spot on Bob's toe where he injured himself during the pickup game. The doctor informs Bob that he has melanoma, and while it was recommended that he have the toe removed to stop the cancer from spreading, Bob declines and is left in a state of despair over the news. He talks to Rita, who gives him her own little speech and inspires him to return home to Jamaica.1978 - Bob makes his return to Jamaica, with a huge crowd gathering for him as the plane lands. Bob visits his old home, which is now empty. The same gunman that shot him enters the house, asking Bob for forgiveness. Bob says he holds no vengeance in his heart. Later, Bob sits with Rita and their sons around a campfire as he comes up with "Redemption Song". Rita says that Bob is ready to perform again.Bob and the Wailers later get ready as they gather for a large crowd in Jamaica for a new show. He then gets up to perform "One Love".Ending text states that Bob Marley passed away on May 11, 1981 from his cancer. However, footage is shown from his One Love Concert where he brought together leaders of opposing political parties as a symbol of unity. It is also stated that Time Magazine called "Exodus" one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers. In the process, the two start to fall for each other. What happens between them is affected by the fate of the book in the club which may inadvertently impact the store.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Language: hi</p>
                            <p>Description: The Royal Delhi Club was full of peculiar characters who, though, moved among the normal people, their lives were nothing like them. The privy purses were abolished in India in 1971, but the people of the club still believed themselves no less than royalty. The fee to join the club is Rs 1 Crores and 99 Lakhs plus GST and a waiting period of 20 years. Even Presidents of the country have played golf there.
A new president was to be elected for the club, and Shehnaz Noorani (Karisma Kapoor), an actress and socialite, and Ranvijay Singh (Sanjay Kapoor), who still asked people to address him as "Hukum," were standing against each other. Devendra Bhatti (Deven Bhojani) is the current president of the club.
Amidst all these pretentious people was a man named Akash Dogra, (Vijay Varma) who told his family that he didn't like going to the club since he was against classicism. Bambi (Sara Ali Khan), whose husband died in a bus crash, also arrived at the gala, and before marriage, she was very close to Akash. For some unknown reason, they couldn't get married, but the spark was still there.
Akash is the son of Brigadier Balbir Dogra (Purnendu Bhattacharya) and Mrs. Mala Dogra (Grusha Kapoor). Cookie Katoch (Dimple Kapadia) is a member and drinks a special beetroot juice that is handmade. Cookie is an artists and makes decorative sculptures for the club.
Guppie is the gardener and has dementia.The dead body of the club fitness trainer, Leo Mathews (Aashim Gulati), was found in the gym. Leo was exercising and apparently while doing bench press, the bar slipped and fell on his neck, killing him. The CCTV of the gym were covered up by balloons at the time of Leo's death between 5 and 7 am.
That's when ACP Bhavani (Pankaj Tripathi) and sub-inspector Padam (Priyank Tiwary) took charge of the matter and started investigating the case. Bhavani concludes that Leo was murdered. The body was discovered when Cookie, Bambi and Roshni went to the gym at 7 am.
Akash is a lawyer and was also representing Leo. The night before the murder, the club hosted Tambola night, and Leo was reading the numbers. Ranvijay got into a fight with Leo when he called Ranvijay "uncle", after he won the full house. Akash came to defend Leo, and he and Ranvijay traded blows with each other.
Next to Leo's body was his protein shake drink which was prepared by gym trainers Thinsuk or Theju. Minu is a waitress at the club and is Theju's girlfriend. Ganga works at the club's beauty parlor and is rumored to be having an affair with Ranvijay, after the death of her husband.
ACP often saw Guppie (Brijendra Kala) excessively watering the beetroot plants, but until the time the former went to have dinner at the Dogras, he didn't know that it was for a reason.They found out that Leo was a sort of Robin Hood who robbed the rich and gave it to the poor. He had a charitable institute called the Shepherd's Home orphanage, and he found ways to coerce the members of the club to donate money there.
Bambi tells Akash that Leo was blackmailing her as he knew that she was a Kleptomaniac. Bhavani searches Leo's room and finds that his tablet is missing on which he used to record his videos.
The autopsy report indicates that Leo was drugged with an opiate prior to his death. The opiate would have turned his bones to rubber, and muscles into jelly. Leo's protein shake had no traces of the opiate, but a spill at the front of gym had some traces where the club cat Prince Harry was found unconscious.Bambi and Akash find out about the opiate connection and learn that the drug supplier to the club used to be Ajay Kumar, Ganga's husband who vanished 3 years ago. They also see Yash, Roshni's son buying drugs, even though he is supposed to be clean post rehab. Bambi breaks into Yash's home and finds evidence that Yash was using the same opiates found in Leo's bloodstream.
Before Bhavani could examine Prince Harry, he was found roasted in Guppie's oven. Guppie believes he put Prince Harry in the oven and caused its death. Bambi speaks to Guppie and consoles him but realizes that Yash was spying on them.
Ranvijay wins the election. That night Guppie was found murdered in his room, and the body was discovered by Yash and Akash.
The ACP, for the longest time, did not understand why such a poor soul was murdered. But then it struck the ACP that Guppie was actually not watering the plants, but in reality, he was trying to melt the bones of the skeleton that lay underneath by sprinkling acid on the soil.Akash finds earnings that he had gifted to Bambi, in the evidence related to Leo's murder. When he confronts Bambi, she claims that she had a physical relationship with Leo, and the earrings were payment to keep his mouth shut.
Akash reports Yash's opiate stock in his house, but Bhavani finds nothing there.The kitchen garden, which was named after Ranvijay Singh's late wife, was dug up, and the skeleton was found. The skeleton had crystal shards inside the eye socket.ACP Bhavani was interrogating every member of the Royal Delhi Club, and he got to know a lot of dirty secrets about them.
He found out that Ranvijay Singh was in a relationship with Thinsuk (a gym trainer as well), and his entire life was a big lie. He had no money, and he rented cars every day from a mechanic to mislead the people into believing that he still lived a life of privileges. In reality, Ranvijay just waited for the time when he could go to the club and feel like he was still the king. Leo was blackmailing Ranvijay because he knew his reality and also about his relationship with Thinsuk, which was why he was forced to donate to the orphanage.
At Ranvijay's house, Bhavani finds a decorative sculpture of Mother Teresa with some crystal shards missing. Cookie recognizes her work and says that she made 2 sculptures, one for Ranvijay and 2nd one to the Dogras.At first, everybody thought that the skeleton would be of Ganga's (Tara Alisha Berry) missing husband, Ajay Kumar (Alok Panwar).
Ajay supplied drugs to a lot of people in the club, and he subjected Ganga to physical abuse a lot of times. But a twist came when Ajay Kumar was caught alive by Padam, and that's when the ACP realized that reality was not how it seemed at first.
After the DNA reports came, ACP Bhavani got to know that the skeleton was of Anshul (Varun Mitra), Bambi's husband, who was believed to have passed away in a bus crash. After the revelation, Akash Dogra became the prime suspect, as everybody knew that he loved Bambi and that he always wanted to marry her.
Akash goes missing after he gets a call from Rakesh that he found Leo's tablet. This is when Yash is found in his bathtub trying to commit suicide, with a suicide note by his side. But Roshni arrives and saves him. Yash goes into a coma.The ACP called everybody to the Royal Delhi Club, as he wanted to expose the murderer in the presence of all the members.Rakesh, the warden of the orphanage, was Shehnaz's son, and Leo knew about that fact. He blackmailed her and told her that he would tell everybody about her reality if she didn't make huge donations.
ACP had come to know about that fact as one day Shehnaz got provoked by something he said, and she told him how she delivered a baby during the 1992 Mumbai riots. ACP Bhavani knew that Shehnaz's two daughters were not so old, and so he speculated that she must have had another child about whom the world didn't know.Yash (Suhail Nayyar) was a drug addict, and his mother, Roshni Batra (Tisca Chopra), knew about that fact but hid it from the world.ACP firstly tried to frame Yash for all three murders. He said that Yash used to secretly record videos of Bambi, and he tried taking his life as he couldn't see her with Akash. But then Roshni lost her temper.
The ACP created yet another theory according to which Akash Dogra was the killer. The ACP said that on the day of Bambi's and Anshul's anniversary, Akash left the party early, but he once again came back late at night. In the footage recovered from Leo's tab, it was evident that Akash's car was parked at the Royal Delhi Club premises, and he was even seen entering the property.
The ACP told Akash and others that the CCTV footage from that night had been deleted, and even the sculpture that was used as the murder weapon was missing from the day when the incident took place. ACP Bhavani arrested Akash, but Bambi stopped him and said that Yash, before trying to take his life, had written a note in which he had confessed to having killed Anshul, Leo, and Guppie.
But the ACP stuck to his narrative and said that, according to him, it was Akash who had written that letter and left it in the bathtub where Yash was lying.Actually, the ACP had figured out who the murderer was, and he was just lying because he wanted the culprit to come forward. He knew that incriminating Yash would enrage his mother, and then framing Akash would make the killer expose her identity. When Akash was being taken to the police station, Bambi asked the ACP to stop.
That's when Bambi confessed that she was the one who had killed her husband, as he was going to leave her for Ganga. She said that Leo had learned from Guppie that Anshul's skeleton had been buried in the kitchen garden, which was why she had to kill him. Then she went on to kill Guppie, as he was the last witness left.
Bambi was a smart woman, and she knew that she needed to frame somebody for the murders so that the accusation did not come against her or Akash. So that's why she went to kill Yash and left that suicide note near his body. But luckily, Yash survived, though he went into a state of coma due to a drug overdose.
Bhavani found from Akash's grandmother that the bust gifted to them by Cookie was returned to Bambi.
Bambi handed herself over to the law enforcement authorities, and finally, she accepted her defeat.Bambi knew that Anshul didn't love her and that he was cheating on her. But still, she called her marriage perfect, as, according to her perspective, love wasn't an essential ingredient for making a marriage work. Bambi said that two people need to be of the same class as they had to be in a society where they had to maintain their reputation. By reputation, she meant that she needed a guy who had equal financial status, if not more, as compared to her. Bambi accepted that the privileged class often stayed in their cocoon, and they were too terrified to go out in the real world. She said that a person like ACP Bhavani would find the club, and whatever happened there, to be quite absurd, but for her, it was a safe haven.Bambi told Anshul that he could do whatever he wanted as long as he pretended in front of the club members that they had a perfect marriage. But Anshul told Bambi that he was in love with Ganga and that he wanted to end their relationship. That's when Bambi got angry, and she hit him with that sculpture.
Bambi loved Akash so much that she confessed to her crimes to save him, but still, she was so worried about her social status and her image in society that she knew she would never marry him. She opened up about the fact that she tried to find Akash in her husband, but Anshul was nothing like him.
ACP Bhavani pitied them, and he was glad that he had the freedom to be himself at all times. In the end, he advised Akash to not take Bambi's case, but looking at him, he knew that his heart wouldn't allow him to do that.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location.
They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief.
Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken.
Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.
Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.
In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague.
Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along.This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in.
Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves.
The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection.
This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house.
Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her.The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth.
Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief.
So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work.
However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up.
Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal.
Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.
On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.</p>

                            <p>Description: Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may still be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must replace her by drinking the Water of Life: a poison fatal for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sand-worm, and taking part in raids against Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names "Usul" and "Muad'Dib". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to secure his genetic lineage by seducing him.Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays North fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads him to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks the northern Fremen-including Sietch Tabr-forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south; Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Paul now has a clearer vision of the past, present, and future. He sees an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and learns that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures.The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar to a death duel for leadership. He refuses and galvanizes the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch an offensive using atomics and sand-worms to overpower the Sardaukar forces. Paul murders the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands Irulan's hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement in the destruction of House Atreides. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring.After the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war.Chani refuses to bow to him and departs alone on a sand-worm.</p>

                            <p>Description: In-between jobs, New York City fashion psychologist Lauren Elliott accepts short term work for her best friend Charlotte Gauthier's new boss, neurotic and high strung Virgil St-James, the successful head designer at Lavigne, a Paris fashion house, in the lead up to the debut of Virgil's latest collection at Paris Fashion Week. Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

                            <p>Description: Within the walls of the Grave, the orphanage where Nica grew up, a legend has always been told: that of the maker of tears, a mysterious craftsman, guilty of crafting all the fears and anxieties that inhabit the hearts of men. But at seventeen years old, the time has come for Nica to leave fairy tales behind. Her biggest dream is about to come true. Mr and Mrs Milligan have started the adoption process and are ready to give her the family she has always wanted. In her new home, however, Nica is not alone. Along with her, Rigel, a restless and mysterious orphan, the last person in the world Nica would want as an adoptive brother, is also taken from the Grave. Rigel is intelligent, smart, plays the piano like an enchanting demon and has a beauty that can enchant, but his angelic appearance conceals a dark nature. Even though Nica and Rigel are united by a common past of pain and hardship, living together seems impossible, but kindness and anger are two different ways of fighting pain to stay alive and to conceal the emotions that devastate their hearts, becoming for each other that tears-maker of legend. To the maker of tears you cannot lie: and they will have to find the courage to accept that desperate force that attract them towards each other called love.</p>

                            <p>Description: Amanda Raymond moved back to her family's flower farm after her father Craig Raymond's passing a year ago. That milestone not only was to help her mother Grace Raymond run the farm, but led to her turning her back on the church for God taking her father away from them. Amanda and Grace are facing problems this Easter season, one of their most economically profitable seasons of the year, with the unseasonable cold weather meaning no flowers yet. Behind on the mortgage payment, they are at risk of losing the farm, Craig's legacy. While Craig was the floral designer in the family, Amanda, who has no training or natural ability at such, works toward a Hail Mary in planning to enter the annual Easter statewide flower arranging competition, the $20,000 first prize which would tie them over financially. The only reason why Amanda is considering it is because Lori Matthews, a trained now retired florist who has just moved to town and who Amanda helped out of a bind in their first meeting, has offered to be her teacher. Many of Lori's lessons take them away from the floral table, sometimes to the church where her son Derrick Matthews is the new pastor, that initial entrance back into the church still being a painful one for Amanda. Both Lori and Derrick are facing their own demons, one which Lori may have to face in moving to town, and one Derrick has run away from in moving to town. In the process of the floral competition, their collective issues may come to a head as Amanda and Derrick start to fall for each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Children's book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Alice enjoys Jessica but Taylor keeps her at arms length. Jessica is plagued by nightmares which include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear in the basement named Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor named Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, reunites with her. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember.Alice and Taylor's mentally disturbed biological mother Samantha sneaks into the house to see her daughters and attacks Jessica. When the police arrive to arrest Samantha, Taylor confesses to texting her. Jessica then puts Alice and Chauncey to bed, and remarks that she had a similar childhood friend.Max leaves to embark on tour and Alice becomes hyper-focused on a scavenger hunt she claims was given to her by Chauncey. Chauncey's overwhelming presence in Alice's life begins to disturb Jessica. One day when Jessica leaves to visit Ben, Taylor invites an acquaintance over, Liam. Liam grabs a bottle of liquor which he accidentally shatters. He attempts to find a towel before being toyed with by Chauncey, who briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica arrives back home, angering Taylor.Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail prompting her to call a child psychologist named Dr. Soto. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey while also speaking on his behalf. Chauncey makes threatening remarks towards Jessica and Alice sobs over their crumbling friendship. Jessica later discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto then shows Jessica footage of a past patient who uses the same phrase as Alice: "Never Ever". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey which Taylor blames her stepmother for.Taylor meets Gloria, who tells her that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains to Taylor that imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned, which Jessica did with Chauncey. At home, Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and of the Never Ever. All three women complete the scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm to appear.In the Never Ever realm, the group find a door showing Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, Jessica was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but he became mad in the process after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Afterwards, Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm throughout her life.

                            <p>Description: Within the walls of the Grave, the orphanage where Nica grew up, a legend has always been told: that of the maker of tears, a mysterious craftsman, guilty of crafting all the fears and anxieties that inhabit the hearts of men. But at seventeen years old, the time has come for Nica to leave fairy tales behind. Her biggest dream is about to come true. Mr and Mrs Milligan have started the adoption process and are ready to give her the family she has always wanted. In her new home, however, Nica is not alone. Along with her, Rigel, a restless and mysterious orphan, the last person in the world Nica would want as an adoptive brother, is also taken from the Grave. Rigel is intelligent, smart, plays the piano like an enchanting demon and has a beauty that can enchant, but his angelic appearance conceals a dark nature. Even though Nica and Rigel are united by a common past of pain and hardship, living together seems impossible, but kindness and anger are two different ways of fighting pain to stay alive and to conceal the emotions that devastate their hearts, becoming for each other that tears-maker of legend. To the maker of tears you cannot lie: and they will have to find the courage to accept that desperate force that attract them towards each other called love.</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

                            <p>Description: In-between jobs, New York City fashion psychologist Lauren Elliott accepts short term work for her best friend Charlotte Gauthier's new boss, neurotic and high strung Virgil St-James, the successful head designer at Lavigne, a Paris fashion house, in the lead up to the debut of Virgil's latest collection at Paris Fashion Week. Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may still be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must replace her by drinking the Water of Life: a poison fatal for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sand-worm, and taking part in raids against Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names "Usul" and "Muad'Dib". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to secure his genetic lineage by seducing him.Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays North fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads him to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks the northern Fremen-including Sietch Tabr-forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south; Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Paul now has a clearer vision of the past, present, and future. He sees an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and learns that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures.The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar to a death duel for leadership. He refuses and galvanizes the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch an offensive using atomics and sand-worms to overpower the Sardaukar forces. Paul murders the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands Irulan's hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement in the destruction of House Atreides. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring.After the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war.Chani refuses to bow to him and departs alone on a sand-worm.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location.
They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief.
Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken.
Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.
Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.
In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague.
Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along.This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in.
Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves.
The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection.
This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house.
Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her.The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth.
Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief.
So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work.
However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up.
Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal.
Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.
On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.</p>

                            <p>Description: The Royal Delhi Club was full of peculiar characters who, though, moved among the normal people, their lives were nothing like them. The privy purses were abolished in India in 1971, but the people of the club still believed themselves no less than royalty. The fee to join the club is Rs 1 Crores and 99 Lakhs plus GST and a waiting period of 20 years. Even Presidents of the country have played golf there.
A new president was to be elected for the club, and Shehnaz Noorani (Karisma Kapoor), an actress and socialite, and Ranvijay Singh (Sanjay Kapoor), who still asked people to address him as "Hukum," were standing against each other. Devendra Bhatti (Deven Bhojani) is the current president of the club.
Amidst all these pretentious people was a man named Akash Dogra, (Vijay Varma) who told his family that he didn't like going to the club since he was against classicism. Bambi (Sara Ali Khan), whose husband died in a bus crash, also arrived at the gala, and before marriage, she was very close to Akash. For some unknown reason, they couldn't get married, but the spark was still there.
Akash is the son of Brigadier Balbir Dogra (Purnendu Bhattacharya) and Mrs. Mala Dogra (Grusha Kapoor). Cookie Katoch (Dimple Kapadia) is a member and drinks a special beetroot juice that is handmade. Cookie is an artists and makes decorative sculptures for the club.
Guppie is the gardener and has dementia.The dead body of the club fitness trainer, Leo Mathews (Aashim Gulati), was found in the gym. Leo was exercising and apparently while doing bench press, the bar slipped and fell on his neck, killing him. The CCTV of the gym were covered up by balloons at the time of Leo's death between 5 and 7 am.
That's when ACP Bhavani (Pankaj Tripathi) and sub-inspector Padam (Priyank Tiwary) took charge of the matter and started investigating the case. Bhavani concludes that Leo was murdered. The body was discovered when Cookie, Bambi and Roshni went to the gym at 7 am.
Akash is a lawyer and was also representing Leo. The night before the murder, the club hosted Tambola night, and Leo was reading the numbers. Ranvijay got into a fight with Leo when he called Ranvijay "uncle", after he won the full house. Akash came to defend Leo, and he and Ranvijay traded blows with each other.
Next to Leo's body was his protein shake drink which was prepared by gym trainers Thinsuk or Theju. Minu is a waitress at the club and is Theju's girlfriend. Ganga works at the club's beauty parlor and is rumored to be having an affair with Ranvijay, after the death of her husband.
ACP often saw Guppie (Brijendra Kala) excessively watering the beetroot plants, but until the time the former went to have dinner at the Dogras, he didn't know that it was for a reason.They found out that Leo was a sort of Robin Hood who robbed the rich and gave it to the poor. He had a charitable institute called the Shepherd's Home orphanage, and he found ways to coerce the members of the club to donate money there.
Bambi tells Akash that Leo was blackmailing her as he knew that she was a Kleptomaniac. Bhavani searches Leo's room and finds that his tablet is missing on which he used to record his videos.
The autopsy report indicates that Leo was drugged with an opiate prior to his death. The opiate would have turned his bones to rubber, and muscles into jelly. Leo's protein shake had no traces of the opiate, but a spill at the front of gym had some traces where the club cat Prince Harry was found unconscious.Bambi and Akash find out about the opiate connection and learn that the drug supplier to the club used to be Ajay Kumar, Ganga's husband who vanished 3 years ago. They also see Yash, Roshni's son buying drugs, even though he is supposed to be clean post rehab. Bambi breaks into Yash's home and finds evidence that Yash was using the same opiates found in Leo's bloodstream.
Before Bhavani could examine Prince Harry, he was found roasted in Guppie's oven. Guppie believes he put Prince Harry in the oven and caused its death. Bambi speaks to Guppie and consoles him but realizes that Yash was spying on them.
Ranvijay wins the election. That night Guppie was found murdered in his room, and the body was discovered by Yash and Akash.
The ACP, for the longest time, did not understand why such a poor soul was murdered. But then it struck the ACP that Guppie was actually not watering the plants, but in reality, he was trying to melt the bones of the skeleton that lay underneath by sprinkling acid on the soil.Akash finds earnings that he had gifted to Bambi, in the evidence related to Leo's murder. When he confronts Bambi, she claims that she had a physical relationship with Leo, and the earrings were payment to keep his mouth shut.
Akash reports Yash's opiate stock in his house, but Bhavani finds nothing there.The kitchen garden, which was named after Ranvijay Singh's late wife, was dug up, and the skeleton was found. The skeleton had crystal shards inside the eye socket.ACP Bhavani was interrogating every member of the Royal Delhi Club, and he got to know a lot of dirty secrets about them.
He found out that Ranvijay Singh was in a relationship with Thinsuk (a gym trainer as well), and his entire life was a big lie. He had no money, and he rented cars every day from a mechanic to mislead the people into believing that he still lived a life of privileges. In reality, Ranvijay just waited for the time when he could go to the club and feel like he was still the king. Leo was blackmailing Ranvijay because he knew his reality and also about his relationship with Thinsuk, which was why he was forced to donate to the orphanage.
At Ranvijay's house, Bhavani finds a decorative sculpture of Mother Teresa with some crystal shards missing. Cookie recognizes her work and says that she made 2 sculptures, one for Ranvijay and 2nd one to the Dogras.At first, everybody thought that the skeleton would be of Ganga's (Tara Alisha Berry) missing husband, Ajay Kumar (Alok Panwar).
Ajay supplied drugs to a lot of people in the club, and he subjected Ganga to physical abuse a lot of times. But a twist came when Ajay Kumar was caught alive by Padam, and that's when the ACP realized that reality was not how it seemed at first.
After the DNA reports came, ACP Bhavani got to know that the skeleton was of Anshul (Varun Mitra), Bambi's husband, who was believed to have passed away in a bus crash. After the revelation, Akash Dogra became the prime suspect, as everybody knew that he loved Bambi and that he always wanted to marry her.
Akash goes missing after he gets a call from Rakesh that he found Leo's tablet. This is when Yash is found in his bathtub trying to commit suicide, with a suicide note by his side. But Roshni arrives and saves him. Yash goes into a coma.The ACP called everybody to the Royal Delhi Club, as he wanted to expose the murderer in the presence of all the members.Rakesh, the warden of the orphanage, was Shehnaz's son, and Leo knew about that fact. He blackmailed her and told her that he would tell everybody about her reality if she didn't make huge donations.
ACP had come to know about that fact as one day Shehnaz got provoked by something he said, and she told him how she delivered a baby during the 1992 Mumbai riots. ACP Bhavani knew that Shehnaz's two daughters were not so old, and so he speculated that she must have had another child about whom the world didn't know.Yash (Suhail Nayyar) was a drug addict, and his mother, Roshni Batra (Tisca Chopra), knew about that fact but hid it from the world.ACP firstly tried to frame Yash for all three murders. He said that Yash used to secretly record videos of Bambi, and he tried taking his life as he couldn't see her with Akash. But then Roshni lost her temper.
The ACP created yet another theory according to which Akash Dogra was the killer. The ACP said that on the day of Bambi's and Anshul's anniversary, Akash left the party early, but he once again came back late at night. In the footage recovered from Leo's tab, it was evident that Akash's car was parked at the Royal Delhi Club premises, and he was even seen entering the property.
The ACP told Akash and others that the CCTV footage from that night had been deleted, and even the sculpture that was used as the murder weapon was missing from the day when the incident took place. ACP Bhavani arrested Akash, but Bambi stopped him and said that Yash, before trying to take his life, had written a note in which he had confessed to having killed Anshul, Leo, and Guppie.
But the ACP stuck to his narrative and said that, according to him, it was Akash who had written that letter and left it in the bathtub where Yash was lying.Actually, the ACP had figured out who the murderer was, and he was just lying because he wanted the culprit to come forward. He knew that incriminating Yash would enrage his mother, and then framing Akash would make the killer expose her identity. When Akash was being taken to the police station, Bambi asked the ACP to stop.
That's when Bambi confessed that she was the one who had killed her husband, as he was going to leave her for Ganga. She said that Leo had learned from Guppie that Anshul's skeleton had been buried in the kitchen garden, which was why she had to kill him. Then she went on to kill Guppie, as he was the last witness left.
Bambi was a smart woman, and she knew that she needed to frame somebody for the murders so that the accusation did not come against her or Akash. So that's why she went to kill Yash and left that suicide note near his body. But luckily, Yash survived, though he went into a state of coma due to a drug overdose.
Bhavani found from Akash's grandmother that the bust gifted to them by Cookie was returned to Bambi.
Bambi handed herself over to the law enforcement authorities, and finally, she accepted her defeat.Bambi knew that Anshul didn't love her and that he was cheating on her. But still, she called her marriage perfect, as, according to her perspective, love wasn't an essential ingredient for making a marriage work. Bambi said that two people need to be of the same class as they had to be in a society where they had to maintain their reputation. By reputation, she meant that she needed a guy who had equal financial status, if not more, as compared to her. Bambi accepted that the privileged class often stayed in their cocoon, and they were too terrified to go out in the real world. She said that a person like ACP Bhavani would find the club, and whatever happened there, to be quite absurd, but for her, it was a safe haven.Bambi told Anshul that he could do whatever he wanted as long as he pretended in front of the club members that they had a perfect marriage. But Anshul told Bambi that he was in love with Ganga and that he wanted to end their relationship. That's when Bambi got angry, and she hit him with that sculpture.
Bambi loved Akash so much that she confessed to her crimes to save him, but still, she was so worried about her social status and her image in society that she knew she would never marry him. She opened up about the fact that she tried to find Akash in her husband, but Anshul was nothing like him.
ACP Bhavani pitied them, and he was glad that he had the freedom to be himself at all times. In the end, he advised Akash to not take Bambi's case, but looking at him, he knew that his heart wouldn't allow him to do that.</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers. In the process, the two start to fall for each other. What happens between them is affected by the fate of the book in the club which may inadvertently impact the store.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: At a bar in Philadelphia in 1999, a man named Santos sits in a booth, nervously clutching a briefcase. He exits in a hurry and is followed by the bartender, who murders and decapitates him in an alley.Elsewhere in Philadelphia, Jamie and Sukie are lovers whose relationship falls apart due to Jamie's infidelity. After Sukie kicks Jamie out of their apartment, Jamie learns that her friend Marian is planning a trip to Tallahassee, Florida, and decides to tag along. They head into a drive-away car service, where someone can transport a car one-way for another client. Due to a misunderstanding, they are given a car that someone else has already booked for a trip to Tallahassee.Moments later, a trio of criminals-Arliss, Flint, and Chief-come to the shop to pick up the car headed to Tallahassee. They find that Jamie and Marian have taken it by accident, along with unspecified cargo that is part of their illegal dealings. While Marian wants to go straight to Tallahassee, Jamie constantly tries to convince Marian to loosen up by taking detours and trying to have casual sex at lesbian bars along the way. Marian prefers to read Henry James' The Europeans but slowly comes out of her shell due to Jamie's prodding. When the pair finally enter Florida, their car gets a flat tire. They open the trunk and find the briefcase Santos was holding and a basket containing Santos' head and a smoky white substance (likely dry ice or liquid nitrogen).Jamie and Marian are followed by Arliss and Flint, who are led on a wild goose chase by a soccer team who had invited Jamie and Marian to a party. When Jamie and Marian check into a hotel using Jamie's credit card, the mob is tipped off to their location. Jamie convinces Marian that she needs to have a positive sexual experience to enjoy life more, and they have sex. The next morning, Arliss, Flint, and the Chief arrive in Tallahassee, while Jamie decides to use the contents of Santos' briefcase: a collection of dildos that were created from plaster casts of men's erect penises. Marian is shocked, but Jamie insists that she just wants the sexual release that Marian had the night before.Immediately after Jamie climaxes, Arliss and Flint burst into their room, retrieve Santos' head and the briefcase, and abduct the women at gunpoint. In the backroom at a dog racing track, the Chief arrives to meet them all and explains that the sex toys are based on the genitals of powerful public figures, including one that was molded from Senator Channel's penis. Channel is fearful that his reputation will be ruined if anyone learns of the dildo, which Jamie had used earlier in the morning and subsequently left behind in the hotel room. After the gangsters have an argument that leads to Flint shooting the other two dead and running away, Jamie and Marian decide to blackmail Channel.Sukie has also been en route to Tallahassee in her capacity as a police officer after Jamie tipped her off. Jamie and Marian meet Channel at a lesbian bar and give him the dildo in exchange for one million dollars. Sukie intercepts them as they exit and Channel turns back around to try and kill the women. Sukie shoots Channel. Channel survives, but his reputation is ruined when newspapers begin publishing articles about his criminal connections and the dildo collection.The next day, Jamie and Marian meet with Marian's aunt at their hotel. Jamie casually mentions that she and Marian plan to go to Massachusetts, as same-sex marriage is legal there. As the trio drive away, a bellhop races to give them a bag that they have left behind, which contains two plaster casts Jamie had made of the dildo modeled after Channel's penis.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Girls from a shelter home in Munawwarpur are pimped out, and if something goes wrong, they are killed and cremated. The shelter home is run by Bansi, and his assistant is Sonu, who takes care of the operational details.When Vaishali (Bhumi Pednekar) was handed the social audit report by her informer, she thought it was useless material. She did not believe she had the power to stop the abuse that the girls at the shelter home in Munawwarpur were subjected to. Guptaji (Durgesh Kumar) was quite persistent about the case, and Vaishali took an interest when he mentioned that the police had not taken any action even though it had been two months since the report had been published. Vaishali started to investigate the case. Vaishali needs a strong story to keep her channel alive, else she will lose all viewers, and with it all sources of income.As soon as Vaishali started investigating, Bansi Sahu's (Aditya Srivastava) name cropped up too often. She meets Mithilesh Sinha, the head of Child Welfare Commission who says that he has no such information about the audit.
Sahu, a journalist himself, had a huge influence in the village of Munawwarpur. He contacted Vaishali's husband, Arvind (Surya Sharma), the minute he figured out that a journalist was inquiring about the shelter home. He indirectly threatened Vaishali to back off, but it instead intrigued her interest all the more.
Vaishali soon learned that Bansi Sahu had the support of the government. He bought printing papers at a subsidized rate but barely printed three copies. It was a daylight scam, and no one dared to question him. The shelter home belonged to him, and he was also associated with various other NGOs.
All the shelter homes of the state come under the purview of Ministry of Social Welfare, headed by Rajni Singh.
Everyone was afraid of Bansi Sahu, and the Chief Minister Jitesh Kumar (Anand Sharma) was also within his reach. Vaishali's mentor and cameraman, Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra), was a little shaken upon realizing that they would be challenging the government if they decided to expose the abuse and sex racket. Vaishali decided to continue with her investigation and find evidence that would support the claims made in the report.It was almost impossible to find anyone who could provide information about the Munawwarpur shelter home. They tried their best to track down anyone who had been relocated from the Munawwarpur shelter, but they remained unsuccessful. After inquiring at several shelter homes, they finally found hope at one where the cook previously worked at the Munawwarpur shelter home. When Vaishali and Bhaskar introduced themselves, Sudha (Tanisha Mehta) refused to utter a word. She denied knowing or seeing anything unlawful during her time there. Vaishali gave up and was about to leave when Sudha decided to confess the truth under one condition: she was not ready to go on record, and she did not want her name associated with the case.Sudha spoke about her haunting memories at the shelter home. She brought up Baby Rani (Gulista Alija), the shelter warden, and how she mistreated the girls. She used to force the girls to sleep naked while she assaulted them. The 40-45 girls at the shelter had only one room to sleep in, and their health condition was extremely poor.
One of the girls advised Sudha to run for her life, and she soon figured out the reason behind it. They had a doctor who took care of cases where the victims were injured to an extreme degree. Later, Sudha watched Bansi and his men party (including Mithilesh) at the shelter home, and they abused and tortured the girls at random. She realized she, too, would meet the same fate and decided to run away that very night. Before leaving, she heard Baby Rani and Sonu (Satyakam Anand) mention killing a girl they had pimped out.
The details left Vaishali and Bhaskar speechless. They were all the more determined to expose the perpetrators and rescue the victims. The only problem was that the only witness Vaishali had was not willing to come forward. She soon realized that even though there was a lack of evidence, she had to act confidently to force the abusers to react, and that would eventually lead to one blunder or another.When Vaishali learned that a PIL had been filed against the Munawwarpur shelter home, she assumed her brother-in-law, lawyer Suresh Singh (Danish Iqbal), was behind it. Suresh was completely against Vaishali's decision to look into Bansi Sahu's business. He always looked down upon the work she did, especially because she did not fit into the typical idea of a 'good Indian housewife.' Bansi's men also thought that Suresh was responsible for the PIL, and they roughed him up to teach Vaishali a lesson. Surprisingly, Arvind showed confidence in the work Vaishali had undertaken, and now that she had his support, it was impossible to deter her from exposing the criminals.Vaishali decided to constantly update her audience about the case, and she discussed the torture Suresh was subjected to and how the police refused to file an FIR against Bansi Sahu. Vaishali's small endeavor all of a sudden caught the attention of the common people as well as the influential. She approached the first female SSP of Munawwarpur, Jasmeet Gaur (Sai Tamhankar), to seek help. While Jasmeet was hopeful that she would find a solution, her senior advised her to stay out of it because of the lack of evidence in the case. The next time Jasmeet and Vaishali met, she helped her understand the importance of putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department. Only after Social Welfare Department files in FIR, can the Police do anything.
Meanwhile, it is revealed that it was Guptaji who filed the PIL in Patna High Court.Brijmohan Singh's (Pravin Kumar Sisodia) wife, Rajni Singh (Vibha Chibbar), headed the Social Welfare Department, but he was the one who made all decisions on her behalf. Brijmohan was one of Bansi's many clients, and they maintained a close relationship.
Vaishali realized that the only way she could put pressure on the Social Welfare Department was with believable lies. Bhaskar Sinha was assigned the task of pretending to be a well-wisher of Brijmohan. He managed to meet the politician and warned him of the evidence Vaishali had gathered against him and his wife. To instigate a misunderstanding between Bansi and his men, Bhaskar mentioned that Mithilesh Sinha (Chittaranjan Tripathy) from CWC was responsible for providing information to Vaishali.
Later that night, Vaishali discussed on her show the death of an officer from the Sitamarhi Social Welfare Department, and she believed that he was shot dead because he was putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department to look into the Munawwarpur shelter home case. With a white sheet in her hand, Vaishali claimed that she had every bit of information on how the Munawwarpur shelter home for girls operated. She stated that the next day, she would finally expose all the ministers and well-known personalities involved in the racket on her special program, Bhakshak.After the program was aired, the Chief Minister contacted Rajni Singh and instructed her to file an FIR immediately. Vaishali was hopeful that Jaspreet Gaur would be able to take the case forward from henceforth, but as it turned out, the FIR was filed in the woman's police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act. The Child Welfare Association would record the testimonies of the victim, and if they found anything worth investigating, action would be taken. Vaishali knew there was no hope because Bansi's close aide, Mithilesh Sinha, also a sexual predator, headed the Child Welfare Association. After speaking to the SSP, Vaishali realized that the only way to get the culprits behind bars was by gathering evidence.Vaishali decides to meet Sudha once again and convince her to come forward with her story. Sudha was not ready to endanger her life by becoming a witness in the case, but Vaishali helped her realize how she alone could save the lives of all the abused children. Sudha finally agreed to have her statement recorded. She stood before the camera with her face covered and narrated her entire experience.
Bansi and his associates realized it was the end of their free will. Bansi was an egoistic man, and he did not feel an ounce of shame for the heinous crime he committed. He did not allow Baby Rani and Sonu to throw away the bottles of alcohol and contraceptives stored at the shelter home. He was proud of himself, and he did not try to conceal the crime. Mithilesh walked away from Bansi, fearing losing his job. The next morning, police arrived at the Munawwarpur shelter home and rescued the girls. Bansi and his associates were arrested, and justice was finally served.Vaishali Singh addresses her audience, discussing how often the media fails to address issues of importance because of influence. At times, such cases are overlooked simply because they do not appeal to the audience as much as entertaining news does. She expresses her disappointment with the way the world functions, where there is a clear lack of emotion and sympathy, and people prefer to ignore rather than feel. Vaishali continues to play her part as a journalist, but she questions her audience, asking them if they are doing enough to be called human beings in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

                            <p>Description: New York sportswriter Mack (Gina Rodriguez) has spent years devising successful hook-up "plays" with best friend Adam (Damon Wayans Jr.) and their crew. While it has led to countless one-night stands over the years, following their playbook comes with a strict set of ground rules - chief among them: you can't build a relationship from a play. When Mack unexpectedly falls for her latest target, charming war correspondent Nick (Tom Ellis), she begins to rethink the game entirely. As the lines between work, fun, friendship, and romance begin to blur, Mack must learn what it takes to go from simply scoring to playing for keeps.—Netflix</p>

                            <p>Description: Ana (Camila Mendes) is an ambitious intern, dreaming of a career in the art world while trying to impress her demanding boss, Claire (Marisa Tomei) the head of Erwins New York. Ana hopes to earn Claire's recommendation to work at a top art gallery in New York. Claire is a sociopath perfectionist.
Because of the expensive cost of living in New York, Ana currently lives with her sister Vivian (Aimee Carrero) and Vivian's boyfriend Ronnie (Andrew Schulz), who has been urging her to move out.
Amy (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) is Ana's only friend at the office. During an auction at work, Ana realizes there has been a typo in the auction's catalog mislabeling the type of paint used on a piece that is about to be sold. Ana informs Claire of the error just in time to make the correction, gaining her a little respect. Claire fires Billy, the person who was in charge of the catalog.
The next morning Claire invites Ana to serve as the assistant to her assistants on an upcoming work trip to London. Claire asks Ana to pack her bags and to come straight to the airport.Upset by Ana's ambition, Claire's two assistants Suzette (Rachel Matthews) and Renee (Fola Evans-Akingbola) wait until the group is boarding their flight to reveal that they have booked Ana an economy ticket for a flight that leaves 4 hours later. The ticket agent at the check-in desk witnesses this mistreatment and decides to upgrade Ana's ticket to first class. While waiting for her flight in the first-class lounge Ana distractedly answers a phone call and proceeds to spill her Bloody Mary on a wealthy man named William (Archie Renaux). Ana and William end up sitting next to each other on the flight to London and hit it off. During the flight, Ana accidentally leads William to believe she is the art director of her company's New York office. He is very impressed and when they land, introduces Ana to his mother, Catherine (Lena Olin), who is a British celebrity. Catherine is introduced to Ana, and she offers to drop Ana at her hotel.
Catherine and Ana hit it off and she even takes Ana's number to stay in touch.Suzette and Renee continue to sabotage Ana, assigning her an office in the basement and a room at a separate cheaper hotel, while they stay at the Carlson, a swanky hotel 4 streets from William's home.
Arnold (Thomas Kretschmann) is the head of the company and is leading the sale of the prestigious Brovil collection, whose owner is known only to Arnold. Arnold has brought in Gerard (head of Paris office) and Claire to overlook the sale and ensure its success. Arnold is due to retire, which means both Gerard and Claire are up for the top job.
Ana receives a voicemail informing her that she left her laptop in Williams's car. That night she goes to Catherine's house to retrieve her laptop and finds herself in the middle of a party. There she sees Catherine's extensive art collection (which belonged to her husband, who passed away), meets a famous painter, and continues to lie about being the director of a New York auction house named Erwins.
Ana tells Catherine that her husband was a romantic, since his art collection tells a story of love. Catherine reveals that she recently asked Erwins to auction her collection. Her last name is Brovil. Catherine says that she is working with Claire and says that she will ask Arnold to work with Ana instead. Ana says that the sale is a secret, and she would get in trouble if Arnold found out that she was talking to Catherine.Suzette and Renee are tasked with getting last-minute tickets to a performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while continuing to assign Ana to all of the work they don't want to do. Desperate to get tickets to impress Claire, Ana asks Catherine who leaves tickets with William. Ana visits William who is coaching an at-risk youth soccer league. William invites her to have lunch with him which she has to decline due to her workload. William also tells her that there is a party being thrown that evening and his mother, Catherine, wants Ana to attend. Before Ana leaves, Will clarifies that he would also like her to attend, as his date.Ana runs back to the London office and arrives just as Claire asks Suzette if she got the tickets. Suzette is forced to admit that she was not able to and is further embarrassed when Ana shows her up and turns in the tickets to Claire. Background tensions rise as Gerard (Gregory Montel), the art director for the Paris office, and Claire are both vying for the company's head director position.Ana attends the party, with William and Catherine, in a designer dress that she "borrowed" from Claire (Claire had given the dress to Ana for dry-cleaning). Catherine admits to Ana that she is having second thoughts about selling her collection, due to the love of her husband that it represents.
When she suddenly sees Claire arrive with Suzette and Renee, she is scared her lie will be revealed and attempts to run off. Will catches her before she leaves and instead takes her to go dancing at a local bar. At the end of the night, William wants to take Ana back to her hotel. Embarrassed by where she is actually staying, Ana has William drop her off at Claire's much nicer hotel and makes an excuse to prevent him from coming inside. Before leaving, William confesses that he is falling in love with her.Over the next week, Ana and William continue to spend time together, growing closer and developing their relationship. William tells Ana that he has spent his whole life being used by other people but that she is different, and he admires her for being down-to-earth and humble despite her wealth and success. He tells her he knows her job is important and that he has arranged to transfer his work to New York so that they can continue their relationship.At the office, Claire praises Ana's hard work and promises that there will be a promotion in her future. Renee interrupts their meeting to reveal that a major client has just pulled out of their upcoming auction. That client is Catherine, William's mother. At that same moment, William arrives to surprise Ana at work, and she rushes him out of the building. William tells Ana that he had nothing to do with his mother's decision and doesn't understand why she is acting so strange. He questions whether Ana was just using him to secure his mother's sale and breaks up with her.When Ana goes back into the building, she is confronted by Claire who has discovered her lie and her relationship with William's family. She is fired and escorted out of the building.Ana visits Catherine and confesses that she is not the successful art director she was pretending to be. Instead of being upset, Catherine is proud of Ana for her honesty. She says that she was also using Ana by pretending to walk away from the auction to get a better deal from Erwins who had offered her 85 million pounds for her collection.
Catherine agrees to rejoin the auction on the condition that Ana is the one who handles the sale. Ana kicks Gerard off the auction and puts Claire in total control. Ana is re-hired and manages to sell Catherine's art for much more than expected (250 million pounds). She goes back to the soccer field and apologizes to William who tells her that he didn't like her because she was rich, he liked her because he thought she was an honest person.Ana returns to New York and six months later she has not heard from William but is thriving in her career. Ana throws a party to celebrate the opening of her own art gallery. At the end of the night, after everyone else has left, William arrives with a suitcase.</p>

                            <p>Description: Ana (Camila Mendes) is an ambitious intern, dreaming of a career in the art world while trying to impress her demanding boss, Claire (Marisa Tomei) the head of Erwins New York. Ana hopes to earn Claire's recommendation to work at a top art gallery in New York. Claire is a sociopath perfectionist.
Because of the expensive cost of living in New York, Ana currently lives with her sister Vivian (Aimee Carrero) and Vivian's boyfriend Ronnie (Andrew Schulz), who has been urging her to move out.
Amy (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) is Ana's only friend at the office. During an auction at work, Ana realizes there has been a typo in the auction's catalog mislabeling the type of paint used on a piece that is about to be sold. Ana informs Claire of the error just in time to make the correction, gaining her a little respect. Claire fires Billy, the person who was in charge of the catalog.
The next morning Claire invites Ana to serve as the assistant to her assistants on an upcoming work trip to London. Claire asks Ana to pack her bags and to come straight to the airport.Upset by Ana's ambition, Claire's two assistants Suzette (Rachel Matthews) and Renee (Fola Evans-Akingbola) wait until the group is boarding their flight to reveal that they have booked Ana an economy ticket for a flight that leaves 4 hours later. The ticket agent at the check-in desk witnesses this mistreatment and decides to upgrade Ana's ticket to first class. While waiting for her flight in the first-class lounge Ana distractedly answers a phone call and proceeds to spill her Bloody Mary on a wealthy man named William (Archie Renaux). Ana and William end up sitting next to each other on the flight to London and hit it off. During the flight, Ana accidentally leads William to believe she is the art director of her company's New York office. He is very impressed and when they land, introduces Ana to his mother, Catherine (Lena Olin), who is a British celebrity. Catherine is introduced to Ana, and she offers to drop Ana at her hotel.
Catherine and Ana hit it off and she even takes Ana's number to stay in touch.Suzette and Renee continue to sabotage Ana, assigning her an office in the basement and a room at a separate cheaper hotel, while they stay at the Carlson, a swanky hotel 4 streets from William's home.
Arnold (Thomas Kretschmann) is the head of the company and is leading the sale of the prestigious Brovil collection, whose owner is known only to Arnold. Arnold has brought in Gerard (head of Paris office) and Claire to overlook the sale and ensure its success. Arnold is due to retire, which means both Gerard and Claire are up for the top job.
Ana receives a voicemail informing her that she left her laptop in Williams's car. That night she goes to Catherine's house to retrieve her laptop and finds herself in the middle of a party. There she sees Catherine's extensive art collection (which belonged to her husband, who passed away), meets a famous painter, and continues to lie about being the director of a New York auction house named Erwins.
Ana tells Catherine that her husband was a romantic, since his art collection tells a story of love. Catherine reveals that she recently asked Erwins to auction her collection. Her last name is Brovil. Catherine says that she is working with Claire and says that she will ask Arnold to work with Ana instead. Ana says that the sale is a secret, and she would get in trouble if Arnold found out that she was talking to Catherine.Suzette and Renee are tasked with getting last-minute tickets to a performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while continuing to assign Ana to all of the work they don't want to do. Desperate to get tickets to impress Claire, Ana asks Catherine who leaves tickets with William. Ana visits William who is coaching an at-risk youth soccer league. William invites her to have lunch with him which she has to decline due to her workload. William also tells her that there is a party being thrown that evening and his mother, Catherine, wants Ana to attend. Before Ana leaves, Will clarifies that he would also like her to attend, as his date.Ana runs back to the London office and arrives just as Claire asks Suzette if she got the tickets. Suzette is forced to admit that she was not able to and is further embarrassed when Ana shows her up and turns in the tickets to Claire. Background tensions rise as Gerard (Gregory Montel), the art director for the Paris office, and Claire are both vying for the company's head director position.Ana attends the party, with William and Catherine, in a designer dress that she "borrowed" from Claire (Claire had given the dress to Ana for dry-cleaning). Catherine admits to Ana that she is having second thoughts about selling her collection, due to the love of her husband that it represents.
When she suddenly sees Claire arrive with Suzette and Renee, she is scared her lie will be revealed and attempts to run off. Will catches her before she leaves and instead takes her to go dancing at a local bar. At the end of the night, William wants to take Ana back to her hotel. Embarrassed by where she is actually staying, Ana has William drop her off at Claire's much nicer hotel and makes an excuse to prevent him from coming inside. Before leaving, William confesses that he is falling in love with her.Over the next week, Ana and William continue to spend time together, growing closer and developing their relationship. William tells Ana that he has spent his whole life being used by other people but that she is different, and he admires her for being down-to-earth and humble despite her wealth and success. He tells her he knows her job is important and that he has arranged to transfer his work to New York so that they can continue their relationship.At the office, Claire praises Ana's hard work and promises that there will be a promotion in her future. Renee interrupts their meeting to reveal that a major client has just pulled out of their upcoming auction. That client is Catherine, William's mother. At that same moment, William arrives to surprise Ana at work, and she rushes him out of the building. William tells Ana that he had nothing to do with his mother's decision and doesn't understand why she is acting so strange. He questions whether Ana was just using him to secure his mother's sale and breaks up with her.When Ana goes back into the building, she is confronted by Claire who has discovered her lie and her relationship with William's family. She is fired and escorted out of the building.Ana visits Catherine and confesses that she is not the successful art director she was pretending to be. Instead of being upset, Catherine is proud of Ana for her honesty. She says that she was also using Ana by pretending to walk away from the auction to get a better deal from Erwins who had offered her 85 million pounds for her collection.
Catherine agrees to rejoin the auction on the condition that Ana is the one who handles the sale. Ana kicks Gerard off the auction and puts Claire in total control. Ana is re-hired and manages to sell Catherine's art for much more than expected (250 million pounds). She goes back to the soccer field and apologizes to William who tells her that he didn't like her because she was rich, he liked her because he thought she was an honest person.Ana returns to New York and six months later she has not heard from William but is thriving in her career. Ana throws a party to celebrate the opening of her own art gallery. At the end of the night, after everyone else has left, William arrives with a suitcase.</p>

                            <p>Description: Girls from a shelter home in Munawwarpur are pimped out, and if something goes wrong, they are killed and cremated. The shelter home is run by Bansi, and his assistant is Sonu, who takes care of the operational details.When Vaishali (Bhumi Pednekar) was handed the social audit report by her informer, she thought it was useless material. She did not believe she had the power to stop the abuse that the girls at the shelter home in Munawwarpur were subjected to. Guptaji (Durgesh Kumar) was quite persistent about the case, and Vaishali took an interest when he mentioned that the police had not taken any action even though it had been two months since the report had been published. Vaishali started to investigate the case. Vaishali needs a strong story to keep her channel alive, else she will lose all viewers, and with it all sources of income.As soon as Vaishali started investigating, Bansi Sahu's (Aditya Srivastava) name cropped up too often. She meets Mithilesh Sinha, the head of Child Welfare Commission who says that he has no such information about the audit.
Sahu, a journalist himself, had a huge influence in the village of Munawwarpur. He contacted Vaishali's husband, Arvind (Surya Sharma), the minute he figured out that a journalist was inquiring about the shelter home. He indirectly threatened Vaishali to back off, but it instead intrigued her interest all the more.
Vaishali soon learned that Bansi Sahu had the support of the government. He bought printing papers at a subsidized rate but barely printed three copies. It was a daylight scam, and no one dared to question him. The shelter home belonged to him, and he was also associated with various other NGOs.
All the shelter homes of the state come under the purview of Ministry of Social Welfare, headed by Rajni Singh.
Everyone was afraid of Bansi Sahu, and the Chief Minister Jitesh Kumar (Anand Sharma) was also within his reach. Vaishali's mentor and cameraman, Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra), was a little shaken upon realizing that they would be challenging the government if they decided to expose the abuse and sex racket. Vaishali decided to continue with her investigation and find evidence that would support the claims made in the report.It was almost impossible to find anyone who could provide information about the Munawwarpur shelter home. They tried their best to track down anyone who had been relocated from the Munawwarpur shelter, but they remained unsuccessful. After inquiring at several shelter homes, they finally found hope at one where the cook previously worked at the Munawwarpur shelter home. When Vaishali and Bhaskar introduced themselves, Sudha (Tanisha Mehta) refused to utter a word. She denied knowing or seeing anything unlawful during her time there. Vaishali gave up and was about to leave when Sudha decided to confess the truth under one condition: she was not ready to go on record, and she did not want her name associated with the case.Sudha spoke about her haunting memories at the shelter home. She brought up Baby Rani (Gulista Alija), the shelter warden, and how she mistreated the girls. She used to force the girls to sleep naked while she assaulted them. The 40-45 girls at the shelter had only one room to sleep in, and their health condition was extremely poor.
One of the girls advised Sudha to run for her life, and she soon figured out the reason behind it. They had a doctor who took care of cases where the victims were injured to an extreme degree. Later, Sudha watched Bansi and his men party (including Mithilesh) at the shelter home, and they abused and tortured the girls at random. She realized she, too, would meet the same fate and decided to run away that very night. Before leaving, she heard Baby Rani and Sonu (Satyakam Anand) mention killing a girl they had pimped out.
The details left Vaishali and Bhaskar speechless. They were all the more determined to expose the perpetrators and rescue the victims. The only problem was that the only witness Vaishali had was not willing to come forward. She soon realized that even though there was a lack of evidence, she had to act confidently to force the abusers to react, and that would eventually lead to one blunder or another.When Vaishali learned that a PIL had been filed against the Munawwarpur shelter home, she assumed her brother-in-law, lawyer Suresh Singh (Danish Iqbal), was behind it. Suresh was completely against Vaishali's decision to look into Bansi Sahu's business. He always looked down upon the work she did, especially because she did not fit into the typical idea of a 'good Indian housewife.' Bansi's men also thought that Suresh was responsible for the PIL, and they roughed him up to teach Vaishali a lesson. Surprisingly, Arvind showed confidence in the work Vaishali had undertaken, and now that she had his support, it was impossible to deter her from exposing the criminals.Vaishali decided to constantly update her audience about the case, and she discussed the torture Suresh was subjected to and how the police refused to file an FIR against Bansi Sahu. Vaishali's small endeavor all of a sudden caught the attention of the common people as well as the influential. She approached the first female SSP of Munawwarpur, Jasmeet Gaur (Sai Tamhankar), to seek help. While Jasmeet was hopeful that she would find a solution, her senior advised her to stay out of it because of the lack of evidence in the case. The next time Jasmeet and Vaishali met, she helped her understand the importance of putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department. Only after Social Welfare Department files in FIR, can the Police do anything.
Meanwhile, it is revealed that it was Guptaji who filed the PIL in Patna High Court.Brijmohan Singh's (Pravin Kumar Sisodia) wife, Rajni Singh (Vibha Chibbar), headed the Social Welfare Department, but he was the one who made all decisions on her behalf. Brijmohan was one of Bansi's many clients, and they maintained a close relationship.
Vaishali realized that the only way she could put pressure on the Social Welfare Department was with believable lies. Bhaskar Sinha was assigned the task of pretending to be a well-wisher of Brijmohan. He managed to meet the politician and warned him of the evidence Vaishali had gathered against him and his wife. To instigate a misunderstanding between Bansi and his men, Bhaskar mentioned that Mithilesh Sinha (Chittaranjan Tripathy) from CWC was responsible for providing information to Vaishali.
Later that night, Vaishali discussed on her show the death of an officer from the Sitamarhi Social Welfare Department, and she believed that he was shot dead because he was putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department to look into the Munawwarpur shelter home case. With a white sheet in her hand, Vaishali claimed that she had every bit of information on how the Munawwarpur shelter home for girls operated. She stated that the next day, she would finally expose all the ministers and well-known personalities involved in the racket on her special program, Bhakshak.After the program was aired, the Chief Minister contacted Rajni Singh and instructed her to file an FIR immediately. Vaishali was hopeful that Jaspreet Gaur would be able to take the case forward from henceforth, but as it turned out, the FIR was filed in the woman's police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act. The Child Welfare Association would record the testimonies of the victim, and if they found anything worth investigating, action would be taken. Vaishali knew there was no hope because Bansi's close aide, Mithilesh Sinha, also a sexual predator, headed the Child Welfare Association. After speaking to the SSP, Vaishali realized that the only way to get the culprits behind bars was by gathering evidence.Vaishali decides to meet Sudha once again and convince her to come forward with her story. Sudha was not ready to endanger her life by becoming a witness in the case, but Vaishali helped her realize how she alone could save the lives of all the abused children. Sudha finally agreed to have her statement recorded. She stood before the camera with her face covered and narrated her entire experience.
Bansi and his associates realized it was the end of their free will. Bansi was an egoistic man, and he did not feel an ounce of shame for the heinous crime he committed. He did not allow Baby Rani and Sonu to throw away the bottles of alcohol and contraceptives stored at the shelter home. He was proud of himself, and he did not try to conceal the crime. Mithilesh walked away from Bansi, fearing losing his job. The next morning, police arrived at the Munawwarpur shelter home and rescued the girls. Bansi and his associates were arrested, and justice was finally served.Vaishali Singh addresses her audience, discussing how often the media fails to address issues of importance because of influence. At times, such cases are overlooked simply because they do not appeal to the audience as much as entertaining news does. She expresses her disappointment with the way the world functions, where there is a clear lack of emotion and sympathy, and people prefer to ignore rather than feel. Vaishali continues to play her part as a journalist, but she questions her audience, asking them if they are doing enough to be called human beings in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

                            <p>Description: New York sportswriter Mack (Gina Rodriguez) has spent years devising successful hook-up "plays" with best friend Adam (Damon Wayans Jr.) and their crew. While it has led to countless one-night stands over the years, following their playbook comes with a strict set of ground rules - chief among them: you can't build a relationship from a play. When Mack unexpectedly falls for her latest target, charming war correspondent Nick (Tom Ellis), she begins to rethink the game entirely. As the lines between work, fun, friendship, and romance begin to blur, Mack must learn what it takes to go from simply scoring to playing for keeps.—Netflix</p>

Max notices Duffy's skills after he gets into a bar fight and offers him a well-paying job. Duffy agrees and discovers that the "job" is competing in underground fight clubs. The pair make a ton of money on the first fight and decide to travel to LA so Duffy can atone for his past and Max can pay back a crime boss, Sage Parker (Mulroney). They stay with Rachel, Max's sister, and Duffy quickly forms a connection with her. Duffy enters Sage's fight club and eventually wins, but it leads to unwanted attention. Duffy gets tied up in the crime world and offered jobs he can't refuse, including one with Sage's partner and Police officer, Ellen Ridgway. The deeper he goes in this world, the more deadly it gets. Duffy is a skilled fighter, but will he and Max make it out alive?—The Exchange company</p>

"Pignorant" follows former gang member turned animal activist, Joey, as he embarks on a three-year-long undercover investigation.

The story centres around a dangerous mission to expose a long running, hidden aspect of the world wide pork industry - CO2 gas chambers.</p>

                            <p>Description: From Wikipedia:In 1992, a young girl, Rebecca Summers, goes out to her family pool one night to retrieve a toy boat belonging to her terminally ill brother, Tommy. While she tries to get the boat, something in the pool pulls her underwater.In the present day, the Waller family-Ray, Eve, and children Izzy and Elliot-are seeking a new, permanent residence after Ray has been forced to retire from his baseball career due to illness. They decide to purchase a house with a swimming pool in the backyard, especially after hearing that the pool would be good for Ray's condition. Ray scratches his hand while working to clear out the pool in the back yard. When the pool maintenance come to inspect it, they reveal that the pool is essentially self-sustaining, taking its water from an underground spring in the area.As he spends more time in the pool as part of his therapy, Ray's illness seems to go into remission. However, Eve becomes concerned at the changes she sees in her husband. Izzy and Elliot each get attacked by something in the pool, and the family cat goes missing. During a pool party, their realtor, Kay, tells Eve about the previous owners' daughter Rebecca Summers drowning in the pool shortly before Ray seemingly forces a child underwater and almost drowns himself, although this is attributed to a side-effect of his illness.Tracking down the Summers family after learning that there is a long history of disappearances in the house, Eve meets with Lucy, Rebecca's mother. Lucy explains that the water that now sustains the pool was once part of a healing spring, but in order to use the water someone else must be sacrificed to it; Lucy was compelled to sacrifice Rebecca to the pool's entity to heal Tommy's illness. Eve is horrified to realize that Ray is now being healed by the pool but it will take one of the children as a sacrifice.Eve returns to the house to find that Ray is being directly controlled by the entity, which traps Elliot in the pool and attempts to kill Izzy. Eve tries to save her son while Izzy confronts the entity possessing her father, eventually assaulting him with a baseball bat. Eve manages to retrieve an unconscious Elliot, and is guided to the surface of the pool by Rebecca's spirit. Once back in the yard, Izzy's assault and Elliot's condition help Ray regain control of himself. To stop the entity attacking his children, Ray sacrifices himself to it.Deciding to remain in the house so that no one else falls victim to the entity, Eve, Izzy and Elliot make arrangements for the pool to be filled in to stop such a thing happening again.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 1989, Lisa Swallows is a lonely teenage girl still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her mother, who was killed by an axe murderer two years earlier. Lisa's father, Dale, remarries a horrid and narcissistic woman named Janet. From the remarriage, Lisa gains a popular, cheerful stepsister, Taffy. Lisa spends much of her time in the local Bachelor's Grove Cemetery, much to the chagrin of her family.After an unfortunate tanning bed electrocution, Lisa heads to a party with Taffy. She is then accidentally drugged and nearly sexually assaulted by a classmate, Doug. Lisa, disoriented and upset, returns to the cemetery and speaks to the grave of a young Victorian man who died in 1837, expressing her desire to be with him. The young man had been a musician who had fallen in love with a woman in his own time, before she had left him for another man. He was shortly killed after being struck by lightning, leaving him to be buried in the bachelor's cemetery. A bolt of green lightning strikes the grave after Lisa leaves, and the young man (referred to as "the Creature" in the film's credits) is brought back to life as a lovesick zombie.Janet berates Lisa for breaking a mirror prior. While Lisa is home alone, the Creature breaks into the house. Despite initially being terrified, Lisa realizes he is the young man whose grave she dotes on, and decides to hide the Creature in her bedroom closet. The Creature is mute, missing multiple body parts, and covered in dirt and debris, all attributes he is deeply ashamed of.After the break-in, Lisa claims that a burglar broke in to explain the mess made by the Creature, but Janet claims she is making it up for attention and to upset Dale, insisting that Lisa is either "crazy" or "inconsiderate". After The Creature leaves a worm in Janet's food, she chastises Lisa and threatens to send her to an asylum. The Creature kills Janet, cutting off her left ear, which Lisa sews onto his head. Prior, both dump Janet's body into the cemetery. Lisa figures out that, using electrocution, body parts can become one with him. She then uses Taffy's tanning bed to put in his ear. Lisa later lures Doug to the cemetery so that the Creature can cut off Doug's right hand. Doug, terrified, tries to run away, but the Creature kills him and hides his body with Janet's. With these new attachments, the Creature starts looking more like his old self, and he and Lisa start to bond further.The police start to investigate Janet's and Doug's disappearances. Taffy sulks over her disappearance while Lisa is unfazed. Lisa narrowly avoids being implicated before going to the home of her crush, Michael, resolving to lose her virginity to him. She finds him in bed with Taffy, despite the latter being aware of Lisa's interest in him, and is devastated. The Creature then enters, chopping off Michael's penis, causing him to bleed to death. He prepares to attack Taffy, but Lisa intervenes. He then drives to the cemetery, and Lisa, with a traumatized Taffy in tow, follows him. Before Lisa goes after the Creature to kill him, she gives Taffy her late mother's rosary as a token for her kindness and sympathy.Lisa confronts the Creature, who admits he loves her. They leave the cemetery after throwing a police officer into an open grave. Lisa attaches Michael's penis to the Creature so they can have sex. With the police zeroing in on Lisa, and now fully embracing death, she convinces the Creature to electrocute her in the tanning bed. The Creature turns on the tanning bed's highest setting, causing Lisa to burn to death.Some time later, Dale and Taffy visit Lisa and Janet's graves. The Creature, now fully alive and able to speak, sits on a park bench and reads Percy Shelley's To Mary to a resurrected and bandaged Lisa as she lies on his lap.</p>

                            <p>Description: Through rare interviews with victims' family members, eyewitnesses and experts on the criminal mind, this documentary reveals new insights into how Joran van der Sloot's lifelong pattern of violence and pathological lying leads to the deaths of two young women. Few killers have ever murdered again after they became famous for another killing, but on the fifth anniversary of Natalee Holloway's disappearance, Joran murders 21-year-old Stephany Flores in Peru. Hauntingly, his trip there is financed by money he extorted from Natalee Holloway's mother, Beth, after falsely promising to reveal where Natalee's body was for a price. In 2023--18 years after Natalee's disappearance--Beth Holloway finally gets her day in court with Joran, who admits for the first time that he murdered her daughter. His admission brings some long-sought comfort to Natalee's family, but Joran's history of deceit and manipulation leads some to question the details in his latest story.</p>

                            <p>Description: Thirty-something Betty Baldwin is risk averse not solely in being an actuary and risk analyst, but specifically in matters of the heart because she believes a curse was placed on her when she was a teenager twenty years ago bringing harm to any boyfriend. The spirit of this curse seems to have rubbed off somewhat on her longtime best friend Mya who is facing one disaster after another in her wedding preparations to her fiancé Raul. With Betty, she has a history of pulling away from any boyfriend on the slightest hint of any harm coming to him. Betty believes the stars already have it in for her when she is attracted to her new neighbor Alex in he going into the world's danger zones as a photojournalist. Beyond his job, Alex is a risk taker in wanting to live life to the fullest. As they spend more time together, Betty has to decide what to do in really liking him but not wanting to see any harm come to him.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Peter Barrett (Charlie Weber), a CIA covert operative, is approached at a diner by a man in disguise. The man is revealed to be Peter's CIA superior and adopted father, Henry Byrne (Jon Voight). Byrne had adopted Peter after Peter's parents, who were close with Byrne, were killed in a terrorist attack and Peter temporarily lost his hearing. Peter's hearing returned, though now ultra sensitive, giving him ultrasonic hearing.The mission is track at Russian arms dealer/drug smuggler, download the contents of his watch, and then eliminate them. After Byrne leaves, Peter calls his pregnant wife, Elena Maran (Rryla McIntosh), who is also a CIA agent.The mission starts well with Peter easily capturing the target (Doug Chapman), downloading the contents, and wiping out the target's bodyguards. Once the download is complete, which the target had to be alive for, Peter goes to kill the target but is stopped by Elena and two other agents. The target has been the subject of a year long investigation and Elena's team need him to stand trial. Peter hesitates on what to do and the target grabs a gun firing at Peter. Peter is grazed by the bullet but shoots and kills the target. Elena, however, is hit directly in the stomach.Elena survives but loses the baby and eventually leaves Peter. Peter relationship with Byrne also falls apart as Peter blames Byrne for ordering the mission knowing Elena could show up, though Byrne denies knowing that her team was involved.Seventeen years later Elena is still working for the CIA, while Peter is now living a life of solitude as a painter in the mountains in Cascade, Oregon. Elena receives incriminating evidence about the CIA from her colleague, Dennis (Stephen Lobo), shortly before he is killed by an assassin looking for the evidence.Peter, now going by the alias Mark Nicholson, receives a package addressed to Peter Barrett. The packages contain two art books with an inscription from Elena, something she used to do when they were married as he'd always drip paint on the books.He later visits a bar run by his friend Lucy (Leah Gibson). While there Peter is approached by a teenage girl, Sophia (Madison Bailey), who addresses him as Peter. Sophia is Elena's daughter and says her mom told her to find Peter Barrett if anything ever happens to her. Elena is now missing and Sophia found Peter hoping he'd help find her. Peter denies that he is Peter or that he knows Sophia's mother.Sophie follows Peter home and eventually gets him to admit his identity after discovering a painting of her mom. She confronts Peter and claims she is his daughter too, but the house is then attacked by mercenaries with Sophia killing the final attacker. Peter and Sophia flee the house with Peter grabbing a few belongings, including the art books that Elena had sent.Naomi Piasecki (Marie Avgeropoulos), Section Chief for the CIA, watches body cam footage of Peter's attack. She calls in Agent Kim (Luisa d'Oliviera) and orders a manhunt to be put on for Peter, who she accuses of going rogue and murdering eight federal agents who were there to investigate him for possession of classified information.Piasecki and Kim deliver the news to Byrne, now a high ranking CIA official. He is furious that agents when it like they did and accuses the CIA using Piasecki to cover-up old messes. Piasecki tells Kim to put a tail and track on Byrne, believing he is hiding something.Peter and Sophia find Niles (Jason Gray-Stanford), the owner of a computer hardware/software store, and asks him to hack into the CIA network and determine why he was attacked. Niles at first refuses knowing how to, but after Peter shows him his gun Niles agrees to help. He finds that Peter's record is now classified and Elena is claimed to have went dark on a mission.Peter calls Byrne who tells Peter that two agents came to his house asking about him. Peter agrees to meet with Byrne in secret, believing Byrne is the best chance to find Elena. Agent Kim is able to trace Niles' hacking to Cascade, Oregon and sends a team to retrieve him.Sophia once again confronts Peter about him lying and though he feels guilt about lying, he still denies being her father. Meanwhile, eccentric CIA assassin Ghost (Max Montesi), who had previously killed Elena's colleague Dennis, arrives in Cascade and goes through Peter's apartment tracking him to Lucy's bar.Peter meets with Byrne demanding to know why the CIA tried to kill him. Byrne says he doesn't know but has pieced together that Piasecki believes Peter is in possession of something that greatly threatens national security. When asked about Sophia's identity, Byrne also rejects the possibility that Peter and Elena are the parents.Ghost attacks Lucy at the bar and demands to know where Peter went, though she denies knowing Peter. Peter takes Byrne to meet Sophia and he begins aggressively questioning her at gun point. However, Sophia easily answers all of Byrne's questions and he agrees to call in a check on Elena's status, which reveals that Elena was killed in service. Sophia maintains that Elena had to have sent her to Peter for a reason, but Peter once again confirms he hasn't had any contact with Elena for years. He promises Sophia that he is going to find out what happened to Elena and take care of whoever did it.Peter examines the art books that she sent and finds a small flash drive inside the spine. He leaves Sophia with Byrne and heads out. Piasecki and Kim arrive in Cascade and Kim reveals that Byrne is nowhere to be found.Peter takes the flash drive to Niles, who Byrne confirmed Peter's suspicion of being a CIA operative sent to keep an eye on Peter, for decryption. The files all pertain to a CIA black-ops program called The Internship. Peter hears Ghost approaching and he takes cover with Niles. Ghost uses a high pitched whistle to incapacitate to Peter, but he still escapes the store with the flash drive. Ghost questions Niles for information, though it is clear that Ghost knows about The Internship, and then kills him.Peter goes to Lucy's bar and finds her beaten to death. He reviews the files and finds a video from Elena. Elena explains that the The Internship was a program run by the CIA that stole young children to train them to become the perfect assassins. Dennis, Elena's colleague, was attempting to remove an asset from the program when he was killed. Elena also confirms that Sophia is their daughter, telling Peter that she doesn't know how but she's alive. The video breaks out after Elena tells Peter he must protect her and that Sophia is in danger.Peter races back to Byrne and Sophia but finds that Piasecki's CIA operatives have already arrived. He is attacked and kills two guards before Sophia is dragged into the back of a van and driven away as Peter and Byrne fire at the car. Byrne tells Peter to go follow the van and he'll be able to hide himself.Byrne is intercepted by more operatives and Piasecki orders them to eliminate Peter over the objections of Agent Kim. The agents open fire on his truck blowing it up, but not before Peter is able to escape.Peter, who is barely conscious from his wounds, is found that night by Junk Man, a French homeless man who is often found around Cascade. Agent Kim reveals to Piasecki that they have found no evidence of Peter and Piasecki orders them to end the search. The Junk Man is revealed to be Byrne in disguise, who has taken to Peter to a secret bunker for recovery.Piasecki and Kim interrogate Sophia who reveals that she is Elena and Peter's daughter, accusing Piasecki of killing her mother. Piasecki denies that the CIA wants to kill Peter or had anything to do with Elena and then threaten her for more information. She orders everyone, including Agent Kim, out of the room.Peter and Byrne review the files show that Piasecki is running The Internship program, which temporarily dulls certain senses to hope they recover like Peter's did, creating the ultimate assassin team. However, before they can continue looking through the files it receives a virus and self-destructs.Peter remembers that Elena sent two books and likely put a second copy in the other book. Byrne wants to go get it but Peter refuses, owing it to Elena to find Sophia first. He uses a tracker he had given her earlier to locate her, taking some weapons from the stockpile that Byrne had.Agent Kim criticizes Piasecki for breaking protocol with the interrogation and threatens to report her. Piasecki claims she'll report herself after the threat is neutralized and reveals a tracker she found Sophia, something Kim missed in her previous search. Piasecki warns that Peter is coming and to prepare for an attack.Agent Kim orders the agents to various defensive positions but Peter easily infiltrates the facility killing multiple agents. Peter reaches the control room and fights off the agents. Kim leaves Piasecki to help get Sophia to safety. Piasecki intercepts them bringing them to a different part of the facility. She orders Agent Kim to leave them but when Kim refuses, she is shot and killed by Piasecki.Peter is attacked by Ghost who reveals himself to be an alum of the Internship. Ghost wants to be the one who kills Peter, who. he refers to as "Patient Zero." Peter tries to break through to Ghost and get him to escape from the CIA but Ghost mocks him and attacks again. Ghost nearly beats Peter but after revealing that he killed Elena, he infuriates Peter who grabs a wood shard and stabs Ghost through the eye killing him.Peter finds Piasecki and the two fire at each other with Piasecki revealed to have heightened senses as well. She explains that she was an Intern who know leads the program. Sophia arrives with two CIA guards. She orders Peter to put his weapon down and hand over the flash drive.However, Byrne arrives killing the two guards and forcing Piasecki to put her gun down. Peter turns his gun on Byrne accusing him of starting The Internship and being Piasecki's superior, which Byrne admits to. Byrne apologizes for involving Peter, saying they only wanted to find the information. Peter claims Byrne is only trying to save his legacy but he claims Sophia is his new legacy and hands her a gun which she points at Peter. Sophia orders Peter to give over the flash drive but when he refuses she shoots him in the arm. Byrne claims she is the new perfect weapon, kidnapping her after she was born and "pronounced dead." Peter tries to get through to Sophia, telling her that Byrne kidnapped her and after Elena was sent the files and discovered the truth, she confronted Byrne and he had her killed by Ghost. He begs her to decide for herself and not be controlled by Byrne. He tells her how much he loved her mother and her mother loved her while Byrne orders her to kill Peter. She turns the gun killing Byrne and wounding Piasecki.Sophia still expresses admiration for Byrne, but telling Peter he was thinking too small. She warns Peter she is coming for the flash drive and likely won't remember he is her father but she and Peter have a small farewell.Peter returns home and finds the other copy.

In fact, they need it. Looking to shake things up, they decide to ROLE PLAY. The rules are simple - they meet as strangers for one night to rekindle their relationship. While waiting for her 'stranger' at a hotel bar in New York, Emma attracts the attention of a mysterious older man (Bill Nighy), who stays to buy her and Dave drinks long into the night. 24 hours later, the man is found dead and a murder investigation is launched. Emma and Dave's role play game now becomes a case of mistaken identity that leads to Emma disappearing and Dave being questioned by the police for murder.

                            <p>Description: An intergalactic odyssey of love, ambition, and self-discovery. Orphaned as a boy, raised in the Czech countryside by his doting grandparents, Jakub Procházka has risen from small-time scientist to become the country's first astronaut. When a dangerous solo mission to Jupiter offers him both the chance at heroism he's dreamt of and a way to atone for his father's sins as a Communist informer, he ventures boldly into the vast unknown. But in so doing, he leaves behind his devoted wife, Lenka, whose love, he realizes too late, he has sacrificed on the altar of his ambitions. Alone in Deep Space, Jakub discovers a possibly imaginary giant alien spider, who becomes his unlikely companion. Over philosophical conversations about the nature of love, life and death, and the deliciousness of hazelnut spread, the pair form an intense and emotional bond.—Bluewater</p>

                            <p>Description: Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra).
They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer.The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs.
After being "kidnapped", N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million).Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US.
Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation.
Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue.As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan.
Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew,
As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan.The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich.
The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield.
Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars.In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps.Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time.
The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute.Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina.Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany.
Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down.
Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa.Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus.Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control.
Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship.</p>

                            <p>Description: Escaping from China, North Korean defector Loh Kiwan sets out to fulfill his mother's dying wish, to find a place where he can truly own his name and live on his own terms. He travels to Belgium to seek refugee status but ends up being in limbo with no means to make a living nor put a roof over his head. Marie, who used to represent the Belgian national shooting team and is now battling her inner demons, chances upon an exhausted Kiwan and steals his wallet. The two end up in a heated confrontation. And it's only when Marie realizes that the wallet is the only memento left by Kiwan's mother that they begin to be drawn to each other over their shared experiences and emotions.</p>

                            <p>Description: The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon (Shohreh Aghdashloo) residing in his realm. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the dragon's mercy.Centuries later, Elodie (Millie Bobby Brown), the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford (Ray Winstone), receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle (Robin Wright) of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry (Nick Robinson). King Roderick (Milo Twomey) commands a fleet of ships and carriages full of gold.
On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage to help their impoverished people. Lord Boyford says that their Kingdom is far to the North and encounters harsh winters. He says that their stores are empty, and they will not make it to the next summer without help. Floria (Brooke Carter) is Elodie's younger sister.
Elodie travels to Aurea with Lord and Lady Bayford and Floria. Elodie is shown to be an expert in designing mazes.Upon arriving in Aurea, the Bayford's are impressed with the wealth and opulence of the Kingdom. At night, from her chambers, Elodie notices a fire burning at the top of a nearby mountain.
Elodie and Henry initially both seem uninterested in each other but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel.
Lord Boyford confers with the Queen in private and is offered more gold than he could ever imagine. Yet, Lady Boyford can see that something bothers him when he comes out of the meeting.
Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford (Angela Bassett), fails to befriend Queen Isabelle. Isabelle insults Lady Bayford by saying that she is the daughter of a rope maker and not of royal blood. Isabelle is clear that this marriage is a transaction, as her family needs a bride and Bayford need money. Isabelle does not even remember Elodie's name and calls her Eloise.
Lady Bayford futilely implores Elodie to end the engagement.After the wedding the next day, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union.
Isabelle says that when their ancestors first settled on this land, they found the dragon who ravaged their villages. The dragon was the last of its kind, but savage. The King attacked the dragon in its lair and was defeated.
Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters for peace. The King put the duty to his subjects above than the love of his daughters. This sacrifice is commemorated every generation.
Following a ceremony where their hands are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the dragon's lair, then throws her into the chasm.Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. Her cries wake the dragon. Elodie finds many other pieces of jewelry (that didn't belong to her) at the bottom of the chasm indicating that she is certainly not the first one there.
As the dragon talks to Elodie, she realizes that the dragon believes she is from the royal Aurean family, as her blood scent has been masked by Henry's blood in the ceremony.
Elodie escapes the dragon after it burns her leg and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing slugs, which she collects as a light source. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note "Safe Here She Cannot Reach," the names of past victims (Beatrice, Victoria, Artemis, Genevive, Fatima, Carlotta, and many more) and a map carved into the wall. While Elodie is asleep, the slugs heal the burn on her leg.Elodie follows the map, but it leads to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. Elodie is distraught that there is no escape from the dragon's lair.
She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatch-lings, providing the reason for the royal sacrifices. Elodie surmises that 3 dragon hatch-lings were killed by the first King and hence the dragon was provoked into attacking them.
The first King begged for mercy and promised to pay any price. The dragon demanded a royal sacrifice of 3 daughters from their bloodline in each generation to maintain the peace.
A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. Lord Bayford is confronted by the dragon and admits that he traded the life of his daughter for gold and the prosperity of his people. But he could not live with the guilt.
The dragon kills them, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit.The conflagration alerts Isabelle that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, forcing her to kidnap Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. After Lady Bayford rides out and informs her, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who is left alive as bait.Elodie creates a diversion for the dragon to reach Floria. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans. The Aureans claim that the King only attacked the dragon to defend his people, but the dragon says that he came unprovoked.
Elodie says that by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the dragon think of the princesses as Aurean royalty.
The dragon refuses to believe Elodie, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself by spewing fire in front of a rock that deflects the fire back onto the dragon. With the dragon at her mercy Elodie tells her that she has been killing innocent daughters for centuries just like the first King did. Elodie heals both of them with the glowing slugs, thus gaining the dragon's trust and loyalty.Elodie then interrupts another wedding at the palace (After Elodie and Floria, this would be the 3rd princess to be offered to the Dragon in this generation), exposing the Aureans' treachery. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the dragon.</p>

                            <p>Description: The film opens in Greece, where suave British spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill) prepares to move in on his target, a terrorist named LaGrange (Dua Lipa). After a brief dance together, LaGrange has her assassins draw their guns on Argylle. He then contacts his partner Keira (Ariana DeBose), who uses her tech to find a way for Argylle to get out. LaGrange then corners Argylle and Keira outside and fires at them, hitting Keira in the chest. As Argylle tries to save her, he contacts his other associate, Wyatt (John Cena), to catch LaGrange before she can escape. Wyatt catches her, and he and Argylle interrogate LaGrange to learn who her employer is. It turns out she is working for Fowler (Richard E. Grant), the director who also employed Argylle and Wyatt. LaGrange poisons herself before she can be brought in, and Argylle now wonders who he can really trust.The scene shifts to a book reading by Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), author of the "Argylle" book series that the character originates from, as the entire scene was from the last chapter of the fourth book in the series. After answering some questions, she later goes to her private cabin with her pet cat Alfie so that she can begin to write the fifth book. She spends the evening writing the whole thing, thinking she has completed it before going to bed.In the morning, Elly is contacted by her mother Ruth (Catherine O'Hara), who spent all night reading the manuscript Elly sent her. Ruth says the book is good, but she doesn't like the ending, calling it a "copout". Elly then starts trying to write another new chapter to try and give the book better closure. She envisions several scenarios to give Argylle a better ending, but she finds herself drawing a blank.Elly decides to take a train with Alfie to visit Ruth in Chicago when she suggests to help Elly finish the book. On the train, she is approached by a man named Aiden Wilde (Sam Rockwell). He pretends to be a fan of Elly's before informing her there are people on the train who are targeting her. Moments later, a "fan" comes by with a knife disguised as a pen, forcing Aiden to jump into action and start fighting assassins while Elly tries to hide, though she visualizes Argylle himself in Aiden's place. One of the assassins is a man named Carlos (Tomas Paredes), whom Elly recognizes from the book reading as a supposed fan. Aiden then takes Elly to the end of the train where he blasts the doors off and parachutes with her (and Alfie) out of the train, where she passes out midair.When Elly wakes up, Aiden has cut his hair and reveals he took her to a cabin. He informs her that the assassins come from a sinister organization called The Division, led by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston). They believe that Elly's books predict certain events in their line of work, and they have already read her manuscript for Book Five and are waiting on her to write the final chapter. Ritter is shown executing his Deputy Director (Rob Delaney) for failing to apprehend Elly and reacquiring a Master File that can expose all agents of The Division. Furthermore, the character of Wyatt is based off of Aiden, while Keira was a real person who apparently really did die.Aiden brings Elly (and Alfie) along with him to find an informant named Bakunin (Stanley Morgan), who was going to deliver the Master File to him. Hoping to get an idea of where to find Bakunin, Aiden convinces Elly to start writing the next chapter, which Ritter and his men listen in on because some fans record Elly on their phones.The duo are led to an apartment supposedly belonging to Bakunin.

                            <p>Description: When three childhood best friends pull a prank that goes wrong, they invent the imaginary Ricky Stanicky to get them out of trouble. Twenty years after creating this "friend", Dean, JT, and Wes (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler) still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet the fabled Mr. Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator "Rock Hard" Rod (John Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role of a lifetime too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.</p>

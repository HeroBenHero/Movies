                            <p>Description: Renowned Korean shaman and her protégé, Hwa-rim (Kim Go-eun) and Bong-gil (Lee Do-hyun) are enlisted by a wealthy Korean American family to identify the mysterious illness of the family's newborn son. Hwa-rim uncovers the curse to be a 'Grave's Call', a vengeful ancestor's spirit haunting them. The family's patriarch, Park Ji-yong, entrust them to relocate the grave to appease the ancestor, his grandfather. Hwa-rim enlists colleagues, a Feng shui master Kim Sang-deok (Choi Min-sik) and a mortician Yeong-geun (Yoo Hae-jin).Sang-deok specializes in selling burial locations for the wealthy, while Yeong-geun owns a funeral home. During their first encounter with Ji-yong, Sang-deok becomes wary when Ji-yong insists on cremating the grave, which is located in a remote mountain near the North Korean border. Sang-deok backs out, sensing a sinister energy. However, Hwa-rim convinces them that she can perform rituals while the grave is being dug to avoid the curse. Ji-yong tells them about a famous monk named 'Gisune,' who provided the grave location for his grandfather.Hwa-rim and Bong-gil perform the ritual, and the excavation proceeds smoothly. One of the grave-diggers severs the head of a human-headed snake, which triggers a bad omen. Yeong-geun insists on cremating the coffin once the rain stops so they store it at a nearby ward. The local custodian opens the coffin and releases the vengeful entity inside, Ji-yong's grandfather. The entity targets his bloodline, killing Ji-yong's parents and Ji-yong himself. The grandfather is revealed to be a Japanese loyalist during the Korean occupation era. Before he can reach the newborn baby, Sang-deok cremates the coffin, abolishing the curse.Months later, Yeong-geun informs Sang-deok about the disturbed gravedigger who killed a snake. He revisits the cursed gravesite and discovers the head of an 'onna' along with a double burial site for a seven-footed standing coffin. He enlists Hwa-rim, Bong-gil, and Yeong-geun to dispose of the coffin. The four excavate it and rest at a temple, where Hwa-rim learns about Gisune Monk, who is Japanese. That night, Bong-gil witnesses a seven-foot figure obliterating a human and pigs. They find the coffin ripped from the inside. Bong-gil gets possessed and the other three witness the creature turn into a ball of fire and fly back to the mountain. The four are taken to a hospital and Bong-gil recovers after surgery.Hwa-rim investigates the creature's origin through the possessed Bong-gil. Sang-deok returns to the grave and finds the creature dormant on the coordinates written on the tombstone. He discovers that the grave's robbers were Korean patriots attempting to unearth a metal pole as part of a Japanese military conquest in Korea. Sang-deok, Hwa-rim, and Yeong-geun devise to unearth the pole when the creature rises after midnight. Hwa-rim will distract the shogun while the others dig. A vision reveals Monk Kitsune embedding a katana inside a decapitated samurai's body, turning the samurai into a ghoul, with Ji-yong's grandfather's grave serving as a cover for the relic. Sang-deok realizes the pole is a sword embedded in the creature's body. Using the Korean patriots' wooden tool and blood, he slays the creature based on his elemental knowledge and regains consciousness with the others by his bedside.

Twenty years after creating this "friend", Dean, JT, and Wes (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler) still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet the fabled Mr. Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator "Rock Hard" Rod (John Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role of a lifetime too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: The film opens with a young Robert Nesta Marley (Nolan Collignon) joining his mother as they take a bus from one home to another. This is followed by text explaining how Bob Marley is still known today as Jamaica's biggest star. He grew up from humble beginnings around a time of violence in Jamaica during the 70s after the nation gained its independence from Great Britain.Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), already well into his career, goes to a press conference after announcing that he is planning to hold a peace concert, "Smile Jamaica", to unite the nation in the face of political discourse. Some critics fear that Bob is making it look like his is taking a side.Kingston, 1976 - Bob is playing soccer with his friends and sons when thugs start firing their guns in the streets. Bob protects his sons and takes them away, telling them not to worry about what happened (this is also where he starts to come up with "Three Little Birds"). They return to their home, where Bob talks to his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch), as the constant threat of violence around their family puts her on edge.Later, Bob goes to rehearse "I Shot The Sheriff" with his group, The Wailers. Rita steps out momentarily and sees two gunmen running towards the house, while a third aims his gun at her head. The two men enter the house and shoot at Bob and his friend Don Taylor (Anthony Welsh), while Rita has also been shot. Despite his injury, Bob rises to his feet and gets Don and Rita to the hospital. Bob sits by Rita's bedside as she lies unconscious. He reminisces about when they were teenagers (played by Quan-Dajai Henrique and Nia Ashi) and Bob began to court Rita.Following their recoveries, Bob still plans on going forward with the concert. Everyone close to him sees it as a bad idea for his safety and his family's, but he insists on doing it. On the night of the show, Bob goes and performs, but he briefly hallucinates seeing the gunman that shot him in the crowd. He then stops the show and reveals his injuries to the crowd before walking off the stage. Rita tries to comfort him, and Bob says he needs time to himself.Three months later, Bob travels to London with some of his friends. While there, they are arrested for possession of cannabis. In jail, Bob recalls how Rita first brought him into the Rastafari movement. He also thinks about witnessing his father abandon him and his mother when he was a child, and he refused to acknowledge Bob as his son.Later, Bob talks to his producer Chris Blackwell (James Norton) over ideas for a new album. Rita joins him in London while Bob and the Wailers are trying to come up with a new sound. Bob listens to the soundtrack to the film "Exodus" and starts to come up with his own song of the same name. With help from publicist Howard Bloom (Michael Gandolfini), the group makes their next album, "Exodus", which becomes a worldwide best-selling hit.Following the album's success, Bob goes on a tour throughout Europe in 1977. Although he sees much more success and popularity, Bob is seen engaging in an affair with a woman, Cindy Breakspeare (Umi Myers). During a pickup game of soccer, Bob is seen stumbling after an injury, but he brushes it off.Chris invites Bob and company to an event. While there, Bob gets jealous at seeing Rita talking to another man. When he goes outside to confront her, she in turn hits back at him with the knowledge of his own multiple affairs and the children he has produced as a result. Rita slaps Bob and also tells him to keep an eye out for Don, as he is doing some shady businesses behind Bob's back.After another show, Bob confronts Don backstage over what Rita told him. He begins to physically attack Don before his band mates and Rita pull Bob off of him.Not long after, Bob visits a doctor after Rita and Chris express concerns over a dark spot on Bob's toe where he injured himself during the pickup game. The doctor informs Bob that he has melanoma, and while it was recommended that he have the toe removed to stop the cancer from spreading, Bob declines and is left in a state of despair over the news. He talks to Rita, who gives him her own little speech and inspires him to return home to Jamaica.1978 - Bob makes his return to Jamaica, with a huge crowd gathering for him as the plane lands. Bob visits his old home, which is now empty. The same gunman that shot him enters the house, asking Bob for forgiveness. Bob says he holds no vengeance in his heart. Later, Bob sits with Rita and their sons around a campfire as he comes up with "Redemption Song". Rita says that Bob is ready to perform again.Bob and the Wailers later get ready as they gather for a large crowd in Jamaica for a new show. He then gets up to perform "One Love".Ending text states that Bob Marley passed away on May 11, 1981 from his cancer. However, footage is shown from his One Love Concert where he brought together leaders of opposing political parties as a symbol of unity. It is also stated that Time Magazine called "Exodus" one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

                            <p>Description: For generations, bumblebees have roamed the earth, tirelessly pollinating our crops and wildflowers, and contributing to the biodiversity of our ecosystems. But with the changing climate and other threats, the survival of these beloved pollinators has been put in jeopardy. "Franklin's Bumblebee," a once-common species, is now critically endangered, with the last sighting dating back to 2006. Today, a group of scientists and explorers embark on a week-long mission every July to search for this elusive bumblebee, hoping to find it before it's too late. This documentary follows the journey of over 50 dedicated individuals as they search for Franklin's Bumblebee and discuss the four major threats to bumblebee populations worldwide: access to food, habitat loss, pesticide use, and disease. Through stunning cinematography and insightful interviews, we explore the vital role of bumblebees in our ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these important pollinators. Join us on this journey to uncover the fate of Franklin's Bumblebee and learn how we can help protect bumblebees and preserve the natural world we all share.—Janice Overbeck</p>

                            <p>Description: Renowned Korean shaman and her protégé, Hwa-rim (Kim Go-eun) and Bong-gil (Lee Do-hyun) are enlisted by a wealthy Korean American family to identify the mysterious illness of the family's newborn son. Hwa-rim uncovers the curse to be a 'Grave's Call', a vengeful ancestor's spirit haunting them. The family's patriarch, Park Ji-yong, entrust them to relocate the grave to appease the ancestor, his grandfather. Hwa-rim enlists colleagues, a Feng shui master Kim Sang-deok (Choi Min-sik) and a mortician Yeong-geun (Yoo Hae-jin).Sang-deok specializes in selling burial locations for the wealthy, while Yeong-geun owns a funeral home. During their first encounter with Ji-yong, Sang-deok becomes wary when Ji-yong insists on cremating the grave, which is located in a remote mountain near the North Korean border. Sang-deok backs out, sensing a sinister energy. However, Hwa-rim convinces them that she can perform rituals while the grave is being dug to avoid the curse. Ji-yong tells them about a famous monk named 'Gisune,' who provided the grave location for his grandfather.Hwa-rim and Bong-gil perform the ritual, and the excavation proceeds smoothly. One of the grave-diggers severs the head of a human-headed snake, which triggers a bad omen. Yeong-geun insists on cremating the coffin once the rain stops so they store it at a nearby ward. The local custodian opens the coffin and releases the vengeful entity inside, Ji-yong's grandfather. The entity targets his bloodline, killing Ji-yong's parents and Ji-yong himself. The grandfather is revealed to be a Japanese loyalist during the Korean occupation era. Before he can reach the newborn baby, Sang-deok cremates the coffin, abolishing the curse.Months later, Yeong-geun informs Sang-deok about the disturbed gravedigger who killed a snake. He revisits the cursed gravesite and discovers the head of an 'onna' along with a double burial site for a seven-footed standing coffin. He enlists Hwa-rim, Bong-gil, and Yeong-geun to dispose of the coffin. The four excavate it and rest at a temple, where Hwa-rim learns about Gisune Monk, who is Japanese. That night, Bong-gil witnesses a seven-foot figure obliterating a human and pigs. They find the coffin ripped from the inside. Bong-gil gets possessed and the other three witness the creature turn into a ball of fire and fly back to the mountain. The four are taken to a hospital and Bong-gil recovers after surgery.Hwa-rim investigates the creature's origin through the possessed Bong-gil. Sang-deok returns to the grave and finds the creature dormant on the coordinates written on the tombstone. He discovers that the grave's robbers were Korean patriots attempting to unearth a metal pole as part of a Japanese military conquest in Korea. Sang-deok, Hwa-rim, and Yeong-geun devise to unearth the pole when the creature rises after midnight. Hwa-rim will distract the shogun while the others dig. A vision reveals Monk Kitsune embedding a katana inside a decapitated samurai's body, turning the samurai into a ghoul, with Ji-yong's grandfather's grave serving as a cover for the relic. Sang-deok realizes the pole is a sword embedded in the creature's body. Using the Korean patriots' wooden tool and blood, he slays the creature based on his elemental knowledge and regains consciousness with the others by his bedside. The four later attend Sang-deok's daughter's wedding.</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are excited about the fun nature of their latest catering gig, a by invitation only medieval ball and dinner at Sir Alistair Harrows' home, Hyde Castle, it a fundraiser for Elk Park Prep Academy, the school that Olive attends, she who will be part of a fencing demonstration at the gala. A stickler for authenticity as his home is one big medieval castle without the latest technology such as computers, Internet or cell phones, Sir Alistair dictates to his butler Klaus that all the guests must be dressed in medieval costume, and only invited guests are to be allowed in. Among the guests are many from the Elk Park Police Department, including Tom, Mason and Dave. One uninvited person who is able to make his way in, just before a storm snows them all in, is US Marshal Gerard Trach, Dave's father, who has come to see Tom to question him about his convict father Edmund Schultz as he has escaped from prison, odd in that he would soon be eligible for parole after twenty-five years served for murder. Tom knows nothing about Edmund's whereabouts as he has not spoken to his father since he went to prison, with this news dampening his spirit just before he and Goldy are to go on a big date. Something else that dampens the entire evening is a murder, the victim who was just about to make a self-described earth-shattering announcement. Tom leads the investigation, with Mason and Dave providing official assistance, Gerard somewhat unofficial assistance, and Goldy her inherent sleuthing skills. Even if they don't know the nature of the victim's announcement, they discover that there are many possible suspects as the victim had many enemies among the guests who can't leave even if they wanted to because of the snow. But what Tom probably did not expect is that his father would factor into the proceedings.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Overly regimented and risk-averse San Francisco-based Madeline Zekko is planning her and her fiancé Jason Reid's honeymoon to Niagara Falls to take place in five weeks time, Madeline not leaving a second free in the itinerary in wanting to recreate her grandparents' love story there. Instead, Jason, who wants some spontaneity in life and accusing Madeline of not having a spontaneous bone in her body, breaks up with her. Madeline's divorced sister Harley is ultimately able to convince Madeline to take that pre-paid, non-refundable honeymoon trip with her to show Jason that she can indeed be spontaneous. When Madeline and Harley arrive at the tour company's office on their second day in Niagara Falls, Madeline is dismayed to see that their tour guide for the week Mike Hollis, the man with who she had a less than pleasant encounter the day before. With Mike's boss and best friend Emily Henley unable to take over Madeline's tours in working on her own tours for her brother Keegan's best friend Phil and his fiancée Beth who will be getting married at the end of the week, Emily is able to convince both Madeline and Mike to give going on the tours together a try. Mike is further able to convince Madeline to change the itinerary somewhat to incorporate adventure activities, Mike's preferred ones as opposed to the plethora of romance tours that are their bread and butter, again to demonstrate to Jason that she is not totally stuck in her box. In the process with Mike opening up about his two year heartache in who he thought was the one leaving him, Madeline and Mike see a different side of the other as they start to fall for each other, Phil and Beth who end up being a sounding board in being able to provide some insight into why their relationship works. A kink in Madeline opening herself up fully to Mike is Jason, for who she went through the motions of this faux honeymoon.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: The Royal Delhi Club was full of peculiar characters who, though, moved among the normal people, their lives were nothing like them. The privy purses were abolished in India in 1971, but the people of the club still believed themselves no less than royalty. The fee to join the club is Rs 1 Crores and 99 Lakhs plus GST and a waiting period of 20 years. Even Presidents of the country have played golf there.
A new president was to be elected for the club, and Shehnaz Noorani (Karisma Kapoor), an actress and socialite, and Ranvijay Singh (Sanjay Kapoor), who still asked people to address him as "Hukum," were standing against each other. Devendra Bhatti (Deven Bhojani) is the current president of the club.
Amidst all these pretentious people was a man named Akash Dogra, (Vijay Varma) who told his family that he didn't like going to the club since he was against classicism. Bambi (Sara Ali Khan), whose husband died in a bus crash, also arrived at the gala, and before marriage, she was very close to Akash. For some unknown reason, they couldn't get married, but the spark was still there.
Akash is the son of Brigadier Balbir Dogra (Purnendu Bhattacharya) and Mrs. Mala Dogra (Grusha Kapoor). Cookie Katoch (Dimple Kapadia) is a member and drinks a special beetroot juice that is handmade. Cookie is an artists and makes decorative sculptures for the club.
Guppie is the gardener and has dementia.The dead body of the club fitness trainer, Leo Mathews (Aashim Gulati), was found in the gym. Leo was exercising and apparently while doing bench press, the bar slipped and fell on his neck, killing him. The CCTV of the gym were covered up by balloons at the time of Leo's death between 5 and 7 am.
That's when ACP Bhavani (Pankaj Tripathi) and sub-inspector Padam (Priyank Tiwary) took charge of the matter and started investigating the case. Bhavani concludes that Leo was murdered. The body was discovered when Cookie, Bambi and Roshni went to the gym at 7 am.
Akash is a lawyer and was also representing Leo. The night before the murder, the club hosted Tambola night, and Leo was reading the numbers. Ranvijay got into a fight with Leo when he called Ranvijay "uncle", after he won the full house. Akash came to defend Leo, and he and Ranvijay traded blows with each other.
Next to Leo's body was his protein shake drink which was prepared by gym trainers Thinsuk or Theju. Minu is a waitress at the club and is Theju's girlfriend. Ganga works at the club's beauty parlor and is rumored to be having an affair with Ranvijay, after the death of her husband.
ACP often saw Guppie (Brijendra Kala) excessively watering the beetroot plants, but until the time the former went to have dinner at the Dogras, he didn't know that it was for a reason.They found out that Leo was a sort of Robin Hood who robbed the rich and gave it to the poor. He had a charitable institute called the Shepherd's Home orphanage, and he found ways to coerce the members of the club to donate money there.
Bambi tells Akash that Leo was blackmailing her as he knew that she was a Kleptomaniac. Bhavani searches Leo's room and finds that his tablet is missing on which he used to record his videos.
The autopsy report indicates that Leo was drugged with an opiate prior to his death. The opiate would have turned his bones to rubber, and muscles into jelly. Leo's protein shake had no traces of the opiate, but a spill at the front of gym had some traces where the club cat Prince Harry was found unconscious.Bambi and Akash find out about the opiate connection and learn that the drug supplier to the club used to be Ajay Kumar, Ganga's husband who vanished 3 years ago. They also see Yash, Roshni's son buying drugs, even though he is supposed to be clean post rehab. Bambi breaks into Yash's home and finds evidence that Yash was using the same opiates found in Leo's bloodstream.
Before Bhavani could examine Prince Harry, he was found roasted in Guppie's oven. Guppie believes he put Prince Harry in the oven and caused its death. Bambi speaks to Guppie and consoles him but realizes that Yash was spying on them.
Ranvijay wins the election. That night Guppie was found murdered in his room, and the body was discovered by Yash and Akash.
The ACP, for the longest time, did not understand why such a poor soul was murdered. But then it struck the ACP that Guppie was actually not watering the plants, but in reality, he was trying to melt the bones of the skeleton that lay underneath by sprinkling acid on the soil.Akash finds earnings that he had gifted to Bambi, in the evidence related to Leo's murder. When he confronts Bambi, she claims that she had a physical relationship with Leo, and the earrings were payment to keep his mouth shut.
Akash reports Yash's opiate stock in his house, but Bhavani finds nothing there.The kitchen garden, which was named after Ranvijay Singh's late wife, was dug up, and the skeleton was found. The skeleton had crystal shards inside the eye socket.ACP Bhavani was interrogating every member of the Royal Delhi Club, and he got to know a lot of dirty secrets about them.
He found out that Ranvijay Singh was in a relationship with Thinsuk (a gym trainer as well), and his entire life was a big lie. He had no money, and he rented cars every day from a mechanic to mislead the people into believing that he still lived a life of privileges. In reality, Ranvijay just waited for the time when he could go to the club and feel like he was still the king. Leo was blackmailing Ranvijay because he knew his reality and also about his relationship with Thinsuk, which was why he was forced to donate to the orphanage.
At Ranvijay's house, Bhavani finds a decorative sculpture of Mother Teresa with some crystal shards missing. Cookie recognizes her work and says that she made 2 sculptures, one for Ranvijay and 2nd one to the Dogras.At first, everybody thought that the skeleton would be of Ganga's (Tara Alisha Berry) missing husband, Ajay Kumar (Alok Panwar).
Ajay supplied drugs to a lot of people in the club, and he subjected Ganga to physical abuse a lot of times. But a twist came when Ajay Kumar was caught alive by Padam, and that's when the ACP realized that reality was not how it seemed at first.
After the DNA reports came, ACP Bhavani got to know that the skeleton was of Anshul (Varun Mitra), Bambi's husband, who was believed to have passed away in a bus crash. After the revelation, Akash Dogra became the prime suspect, as everybody knew that he loved Bambi and that he always wanted to marry her.
Akash goes missing after he gets a call from Rakesh that he found Leo's tablet. This is when Yash is found in his bathtub trying to commit suicide, with a suicide note by his side. But Roshni arrives and saves him. Yash goes into a coma.The ACP called everybody to the Royal Delhi Club, as he wanted to expose the murderer in the presence of all the members.Rakesh, the warden of the orphanage, was Shehnaz's son, and Leo knew about that fact. He blackmailed her and told her that he would tell everybody about her reality if she didn't make huge donations.
ACP had come to know about that fact as one day Shehnaz got provoked by something he said, and she told him how she delivered a baby during the 1992 Mumbai riots. ACP Bhavani knew that Shehnaz's two daughters were not so old, and so he speculated that she must have had another child about whom the world didn't know.Yash (Suhail Nayyar) was a drug addict, and his mother, Roshni Batra (Tisca Chopra), knew about that fact but hid it from the world.ACP firstly tried to frame Yash for all three murders. He said that Yash used to secretly record videos of Bambi, and he tried taking his life as he couldn't see her with Akash. But then Roshni lost her temper.
The ACP created yet another theory according to which Akash Dogra was the killer. The ACP said that on the day of Bambi's and Anshul's anniversary, Akash left the party early, but he once again came back late at night. In the footage recovered from Leo's tab, it was evident that Akash's car was parked at the Royal Delhi Club premises, and he was even seen entering the property.
The ACP told Akash and others that the CCTV footage from that night had been deleted, and even the sculpture that was used as the murder weapon was missing from the day when the incident took place. ACP Bhavani arrested Akash, but Bambi stopped him and said that Yash, before trying to take his life, had written a note in which he had confessed to having killed Anshul, Leo, and Guppie.
But the ACP stuck to his narrative and said that, according to him, it was Akash who had written that letter and left it in the bathtub where Yash was lying.Actually, the ACP had figured out who the murderer was, and he was just lying because he wanted the culprit to come forward. He knew that incriminating Yash would enrage his mother, and then framing Akash would make the killer expose her identity. When Akash was being taken to the police station, Bambi asked the ACP to stop.
That's when Bambi confessed that she was the one who had killed her husband, as he was going to leave her for Ganga. She said that Leo had learned from Guppie that Anshul's skeleton had been buried in the kitchen garden, which was why she had to kill him. Then she went on to kill Guppie, as he was the last witness left.
Bambi was a smart woman, and she knew that she needed to frame somebody for the murders so that the accusation did not come against her or Akash. So that's why she went to kill Yash and left that suicide note near his body. But luckily, Yash survived, though he went into a state of coma due to a drug overdose.
Bhavani found from Akash's grandmother that the bust gifted to them by Cookie was returned to Bambi.
Bambi handed herself over to the law enforcement authorities, and finally, she accepted her defeat.Bambi knew that Anshul didn't love her and that he was cheating on her. But still, she called her marriage perfect, as, according to her perspective, love wasn't an essential ingredient for making a marriage work. Bambi said that two people need to be of the same class as they had to be in a society where they had to maintain their reputation. By reputation, she meant that she needed a guy who had equal financial status, if not more, as compared to her. Bambi accepted that the privileged class often stayed in their cocoon, and they were too terrified to go out in the real world. She said that a person like ACP Bhavani would find the club, and whatever happened there, to be quite absurd, but for her, it was a safe haven.Bambi told Anshul that he could do whatever he wanted as long as he pretended in front of the club members that they had a perfect marriage. But Anshul told Bambi that he was in love with Ganga and that he wanted to end their relationship. That's when Bambi got angry, and she hit him with that sculpture.
Bambi loved Akash so much that she confessed to her crimes to save him, but still, she was so worried about her social status and her image in society that she knew she would never marry him. She opened up about the fact that she tried to find Akash in her husband, but Anshul was nothing like him.
ACP Bhavani pitied them, and he was glad that he had the freedom to be himself at all times. In the end, he advised Akash to not take Bambi's case, but looking at him, he knew that his heart wouldn't allow him to do that.</p>

                            <p>Year: 2024</p>

                            <p>Description: Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location.
They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief.
Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken.
Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.
Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.
In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague.
Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along.This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in.
Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves.
The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection.
This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house.
Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her.The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth.
Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief.
So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work.
However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up.
Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal.
Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.
On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.</p>

Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are excited about the fun nature of their latest catering gig, a by invitation only medieval ball and dinner at Sir Alistair Harrows' home, Hyde Castle, it a fundraiser for Elk Park Prep Academy, the school that Olive attends, she who will be part of a fencing demonstration at the gala. A stickler for authenticity as his home is one big medieval castle without the latest technology such as computers, Internet or cell phones, Sir Alistair dictates to his butler Klaus that all the guests must be dressed in medieval costume, and only invited guests are to be allowed in. Among the guests are many from the Elk Park Police Department, including Tom, Mason and Dave. One uninvited person who is able to make his way in, just before a storm snows them all in, is US Marshal Gerard Trach, Dave's father, who has come to see Tom to question him about his convict father Edmund Schultz as he has escaped from prison, odd in that he would soon be eligible for parole after twenty-five years served for murder. Tom knows nothing about Edmund's whereabouts as he has not spoken to his father since he went to prison, with this news dampening his spirit just before he and Goldy are to go on a big date. Something else that dampens the entire evening is a murder, the victim who was just about to make a self-described earth-shattering announcement. Tom leads the investigation, with Mason and Dave providing official assistance, Gerard somewhat unofficial assistance, and Goldy her inherent sleuthing skills. Even if they don't know the nature of the victim's announcement, they discover that there are many possible suspects as the victim had many enemies among the guests who can't leave even if they wanted to because of the snow. But what Tom probably did not expect is that his father would factor into the proceedings.—Huggo</p>

This is an extraordinary portrait of lives compromised by the turmoil of a bloody war, filmed by Ukrainian soldiers. With exclusive access to a tightly controlled front line, the film follows the mission of a special battalion as they undertake a single deployment on one of Ukraine's most violent battlefronts, a snow-covered forest near Kupyansk. Their mission is to defend a railway line, a key strategic asset that, if captured, will enable Russia to mount a direct attack on Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv.—BBC TWO</p>

                            <p>Description: Rudy's (Rudy Mancuso) life is somewhat of a mess and his girlfriend Haley (Francesca Reale) is tired of him zoning out on her. Rudy's Brazilian mother Maria (Maria Mancuso) doesn't like the white girl anyway, and so when she hears that Haley has broken up with Rudy, she thinks it's the perfect opportunity to introduce him to women of his own heritage, the beautiful Brazilians.
Rudy hears music in everything; it's almost like a form of therapy for him, and his escape from the real world. When he walks down the subway steps, it's a piano. When he sits in a diner with his girlfriend, he can't help but be distracted by the music of cooking and serving. This is exactly why Haley doesn't feel like he cares for her at all.
Additionally, he's always dividing his attention between her and his mother, so she feels unseen.Rudy is in his last year of school, and his only interests are puppets and music, something Haley doesn't understand. She wants him to become more serious in life and get a real job when they live together at university (which happens in 6 weeks). Rudy spends most of his time working on these "hobbies" and works late into the morning down in the subway for some petty cash, which doesn't really help his cause. Haley and Rudy have been together for 4 years. Rudy does puppet shows in the subway and is working on his music thesis. But Haley doesn't believe that Rudy has made enough progress.Plus, he lives at home with his mother. But at least that means he always has a lot of food on his plate. Being broken up makes Rudy realize he should take things a bit seriously. He tries to study hard, but it doesn't really work. Maria sets Rudy up with a nice Brazilian girl named Luana (Camila Senna), which is really embarrassing for him. Luana is really aggressive in her approach, but Rudy pushes her back. This prompts Luana to walk away, telling Maria that Rudy needs help.
His mother sends him to buy fish one day, and there, like the feeling of spring after a cold winter, he sees Isabella (Camila Mendes), a Brazilian. Isabella woks at the fish market and gaping at her Rudy is hit in the face with a fish.Rudy returns to the store later and walks Isabella to a market fair that she was planning on visiting. Isabella is very different from Haley. She's actually interested in seeing the world through Rudy's eyes. Rudy shows how he can turn everyday regular sounds into a rhythm.
Isabella suggests Rudy take his show "up" and actually work on it. In the meantime, at school, Haley notices him trying to ask questions in class (it's only because it's about music). Haley tells Rudy that she wants to give another shot to their relationship.Now Rudy is stuck between his ex of four years, who wants to make things work out, and a fresh perspective, who is more understanding of him because of their matching backgrounds. Isabella tells him how her mother abandoned her when she was 15, and she went back to Brazil for a man. Rudy spends a lot of time chit-chatting with his puppet about Isabella.Anwar (J.B. Smoove) is Rudy's friend and runs a fast-food truck. Rudy confides in Anwar that at this point he finds both Isabella and Haley equally alluring. Anwar asks him to pursue both, while his puppet advises strongly against it.One night, when he's trying to take Isabella out on a date using his friend's truck, he ends up getting shot in the arm. It's only grazing, but this gets Isabella and Rudy closer. They share a kiss and admit that they both feel connected to each other. She covers Rudy's ears when he goes to his faraway place and calms him down.Still, somehow, Rudy ends up two-timing the two girls "by accident". While things are going wonderfully with Isabella, he ends up going to Haley's house for a meal, which goes terribly. Her parents (Bruce (Gregory Jones) and Claire (Regina Schneider)) are racist and don't see how he's right for their daughter.
Rudy asks to meet Haley at a Brazilian restaurant in his part of town to break up with her. Isabella happens to be in the same restaurant getting takeout. Somehow, this doesn't knock some sense into Rudy, and he ends up trying to divide his time between the two girls.
In the end, his mother shows up, and the three women surround him in the middle of the restaurant. Rudy, who explodes finally, revealing to Haley that he invited her there to break up with her because he found "another woman." Unfortunately, Isabella doesn't care if she's the chosen one; she leaves the restaurant.After a drunken night makes Rudy hallucinate that his life is a routine mess, his mother tries to knock some sense into Rudy. She asks him what he wants in life, and he lists a few things. One is to be happy; the other is to spend time with his mother, his puppets and music, and ultimately Isabella. She's kind of his savior, or that's what the dream made it seem like.
Rudy writes a song for Isabella to apologize, but she asks him to speak to her like a real adult. She tells him that he's trying hard to keep something together that he doesn't even know if he really wants. His apology doesn't work because Isabella has always been left with her feelings ignored.It's time for Rudy to submit his thesis, but instead, he turns it into a script titled "Musica," inspired by his own life. Finally, Rudy takes his show above ground and presents a comedy show with his puppets recreating scenes from his life with music and laughter.
Ultimately, after his show is a success, he receives takeout with a smiley face on the cover. This is the same smiley face Isabella drew for him after he got smacked by a piece of fish in the face.</p>

                            <p>Description: Within the walls of the Grave, the orphanage where Nica grew up, a legend has always been told: that of the maker of tears, a mysterious craftsman, guilty of crafting all the fears and anxieties that inhabit the hearts of men. But at seventeen years old, the time has come for Nica to leave fairy tales behind. Her biggest dream is about to come true. Mr and Mrs Milligan have started the adoption process and are ready to give her the family she has always wanted. In her new home, however, Nica is not alone. Along with her, Rigel, a restless and mysterious orphan, the last person in the world Nica would want as an adoptive brother, is also taken from the Grave. Rigel is intelligent, smart, plays the piano like an enchanting demon and has a beauty that can enchant, but his angelic appearance conceals a dark nature. Even though Nica and Rigel are united by a common past of pain and hardship, living together seems impossible, but kindness and anger are two different ways of fighting pain to stay alive and to conceal the emotions that devastate their hearts, becoming for each other that tears-maker of legend. To the maker of tears you cannot lie: and they will have to find the courage to accept that desperate force that attract them towards each other called love.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2018, one of the most shocking crimes in recent Argentine history occurred. Nahir Galarza, a 19-year-old woman, was accused and convicted of murdering her boyfriend, Fernando Pastorizzo, thus becoming the youngest woman in the country's history to be sentenced to life imprisonment for her crimes. However, the story takes a significant turn when Nahir completely changes her version, shifting the accusation to her father, an officer of the Argentine police, claiming he was the real killer. An accusation that the local justice system did not take seriously.</p>

                            <p>Description: Regency England. Of the two Dashwood sisters of marriageable age, Elinor, as the oldest, is the sensible, practical one, and Marianne is the die-hard romantic. In keeping to her word to her dying father Henry to keep the family together and seeing the writing on the wall that her half-brother John will not keep to his word in falling prey to the control wielded by his money-hungry wife Fanny, Elinor makes arrangements for herself, her two sisters, and their mother to move to humble Barton Cottage in Devonshire, from their Sussex country manor on Norland Park in knowing that John and Fanny will take over the manor despite having their own home in London, and that John will renege on his promise to Henry to ensure that his half-sisters and stepmother will be taken care of financially. In Devonshire, Marianne attracts the romantic attention of two men, the first, Colonel Brandon, who she sees as unromantic unlike herself. As such, she favors the second, John Willoughby, who she sees as having the same romantic sensibilities as her. Elinor, on the other hand, sees her first priority to her sisters and mother, and thus puts her feelings for Edward Ferrars, Fanny's stepbrother, on the back burner. Despite Edward stating that he wants happiness in his life over any ambition, career or financial, a union between the two of them seems unlikely regardless in Fanny implying that her mother, Edward's stepmother, would disinherit him in marrying someone beneath him like Elinor in the Dashwood women having no money. Secrets kept by Edward, Colonel Brandon, and Willoughby will affect not only Elinor and Marianne's marriage prospects, but also how they view the men in their lives.—Huggo</p>

He now starts a new life in Hokkaido. To raise money for his plan, he pans for gold in Hokkaido. He hears about the existence of gold nuggets that belonged to the indigenous Ainu people, but were stolen by a man known as Noppera-bo. Right before he was caught, Noppera-bo allegedly hid the gold nuggets. In prison, Noppera-bo tattooed the secret location among the bodies of 24 different prisoners. Each prisoner had a piece that would collectively reveal the location of the gold nuggets. Noppera-bo then escaped prison with those 24 prisoners. One day, Saichi Sugimoto is attacked by a wild bear. At that time, he is saved by an Ainu girl named Asirpa (Anna Yamada). Asirpa's father was killed by the man who stole the gold nuggets and she wants to take revenge on her father's killer. Saichi Sugimoto and Asirpa, for different reasons, begin to work together. More people join the chase for the hidden gold nuggets.—AsianWiki</p>

Rara assumes the role of sole heir to the largest tea plantation in Central Java, while Sutan returns to being a nurse at the hospital. Rara is sure they can be happy. This belief was disturbed when Rara was crushed. Sutan suddenly felt anxious. Rara assured Sutan that everything would be fine and argued that his sleep had been disturbed because he was tired of taking care of the plantation. For Rara's safety, Sutan asks for help from Yusof, his old school friend who is now known to be capable of handling various mystical cases. At first, Rara rejected Sutan's idea, but when the atmosphere in the house became increasingly tense because of the terror of the ghost of a disembodied head who kept coming while saying 'Trinil, return my body', Rara had no other choice. Who is the ghost of a head without a body? Why did he ask for his body to be returned? And who exactly is Trinil?</p>

                            <p>Description: An intergalactic odyssey of love, ambition, and self-discovery. Orphaned as a boy, raised in the Czech countryside by his doting grandparents, Jakub Procházka has risen from small-time scientist to become the country's first astronaut. When a dangerous solo mission to Jupiter offers him both the chance at heroism he's dreamt of and a way to atone for his father's sins as a Communist informer, he ventures boldly into the vast unknown. But in so doing, he leaves behind his devoted wife, Lenka, whose love, he realizes too late, he has sacrificed on the altar of his ambitions. Alone in Deep Space, Jakub discovers a possibly imaginary giant alien spider, who becomes his unlikely companion. Over philosophical conversations about the nature of love, life and death, and the deliciousness of hazelnut spread, the pair form an intense and emotional bond.—Bluewater</p>

Despite Taylor's lack of experience, God convinces him to do the impossible: write a hit movie using his dysfunctional, crazy family as the inspiration. But the Devil (Mickey Rourke) is in the details and he has his own fiendish plan to disrupt the whole deal.—Briarcliff Entertainment</p>

Rara assumes the role of sole heir to the largest tea plantation in Central Java, while Sutan returns to being a nurse at the hospital. Rara is sure they can be happy. This belief was disturbed when Rara was crushed. Sutan suddenly felt anxious. Rara assured Sutan that everything would be fine and argued that his sleep had been disturbed because he was tired of taking care of the plantation. For Rara's safety, Sutan asks for help from Yusof, his old school friend who is now known to be capable of handling various mystical cases. At first, Rara rejected Sutan's idea, but when the atmosphere in the house became increasingly tense because of the terror of the ghost of a disembodied head who kept coming while saying 'Trinil, return my body', Rara had no other choice. Who is the ghost of a head without a body? Why did he ask for his body to be returned? And who exactly is Trinil?</p>

                            <p>Description: Regency England. Of the two Dashwood sisters of marriageable age, Elinor, as the oldest, is the sensible, practical one, and Marianne is the die-hard romantic. In keeping to her word to her dying father Henry to keep the family together and seeing the writing on the wall that her half-brother John will not keep to his word in falling prey to the control wielded by his money-hungry wife Fanny, Elinor makes arrangements for herself, her two sisters, and their mother to move to humble Barton Cottage in Devonshire, from their Sussex country manor on Norland Park in knowing that John and Fanny will take over the manor despite having their own home in London, and that John will renege on his promise to Henry to ensure that his half-sisters and stepmother will be taken care of financially. In Devonshire, Marianne attracts the romantic attention of two men, the first, Colonel Brandon, who she sees as unromantic unlike herself. As such, she favors the second, John Willoughby, who she sees as having the same romantic sensibilities as her. Elinor, on the other hand, sees her first priority to her sisters and mother, and thus puts her feelings for Edward Ferrars, Fanny's stepbrother, on the back burner. Despite Edward stating that he wants happiness in his life over any ambition, career or financial, a union between the two of them seems unlikely regardless in Fanny implying that her mother, Edward's stepmother, would disinherit him in marrying someone beneath him like Elinor in the Dashwood women having no money. Secrets kept by Edward, Colonel Brandon, and Willoughby will affect not only Elinor and Marianne's marriage prospects, but also how they view the men in their lives.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: For generations, bumblebees have roamed the earth, tirelessly pollinating our crops and wildflowers, and contributing to the biodiversity of our ecosystems. But with the changing climate and other threats, the survival of these beloved pollinators has been put in jeopardy. "Franklin's Bumblebee," a once-common species, is now critically endangered, with the last sighting dating back to 2006. Today, a group of scientists and explorers embark on a week-long mission every July to search for this elusive bumblebee, hoping to find it before it's too late. This documentary follows the journey of over 50 dedicated individuals as they search for Franklin's Bumblebee and discuss the four major threats to bumblebee populations worldwide: access to food, habitat loss, pesticide use, and disease. Through stunning cinematography and insightful interviews, we explore the vital role of bumblebees in our ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these important pollinators. Join us on this journey to uncover the fate of Franklin's Bumblebee and learn how we can help protect bumblebees and preserve the natural world we all share.—Janice Overbeck</p>

                            <p>Description: Renowned Korean shaman and her protégé, Hwa-rim (Kim Go-eun) and Bong-gil (Lee Do-hyun) are enlisted by a wealthy Korean American family to identify the mysterious illness of the family's newborn son. Hwa-rim uncovers the curse to be a 'Grave's Call', a vengeful ancestor's spirit haunting them. The family's patriarch, Park Ji-yong, entrust them to relocate the grave to appease the ancestor, his grandfather. Hwa-rim enlists colleagues, a Feng shui master Kim Sang-deok (Choi Min-sik) and a mortician Yeong-geun (Yoo Hae-jin).Sang-deok specializes in selling burial locations for the wealthy, while Yeong-geun owns a funeral home. During their first encounter with Ji-yong, Sang-deok becomes wary when Ji-yong insists on cremating the grave, which is located in a remote mountain near the North Korean border. Sang-deok backs out, sensing a sinister energy. However, Hwa-rim convinces them that she can perform rituals while the grave is being dug to avoid the curse. Ji-yong tells them about a famous monk named 'Gisune,' who provided the grave location for his grandfather.Hwa-rim and Bong-gil perform the ritual, and the excavation proceeds smoothly. One of the grave-diggers severs the head of a human-headed snake, which triggers a bad omen. Yeong-geun insists on cremating the coffin once the rain stops so they store it at a nearby ward. The local custodian opens the coffin and releases the vengeful entity inside, Ji-yong's grandfather. The entity targets his bloodline, killing Ji-yong's parents and Ji-yong himself. The grandfather is revealed to be a Japanese loyalist during the Korean occupation era. Before he can reach the newborn baby, Sang-deok cremates the coffin, abolishing the curse.Months later, Yeong-geun informs Sang-deok about the disturbed gravedigger who killed a snake. He revisits the cursed gravesite and discovers the head of an 'onna' along with a double burial site for a seven-footed standing coffin. He enlists Hwa-rim, Bong-gil, and Yeong-geun to dispose of the coffin. The four excavate it and rest at a temple, where Hwa-rim learns about Gisune Monk, who is Japanese. That night, Bong-gil witnesses a seven-foot figure obliterating a human and pigs. They find the coffin ripped from the inside. Bong-gil gets possessed and the other three witness the creature turn into a ball of fire and fly back to the mountain. The four are taken to a hospital and Bong-gil recovers after surgery.Hwa-rim investigates the creature's origin through the possessed Bong-gil. Sang-deok returns to the grave and finds the creature dormant on the coordinates written on the tombstone. He discovers that the grave's robbers were Korean patriots attempting to unearth a metal pole as part of a Japanese military conquest in Korea. Sang-deok, Hwa-rim, and Yeong-geun devise to unearth the pole when the creature rises after midnight. Hwa-rim will distract the shogun while the others dig. A vision reveals Monk Kitsune embedding a katana inside a decapitated samurai's body, turning the samurai into a ghoul, with Ji-yong's grandfather's grave serving as a cover for the relic. Sang-deok realizes the pole is a sword embedded in the creature's body. Using the Korean patriots' wooden tool and blood, he slays the creature based on his elemental knowledge and regains consciousness with the others by his bedside.

                            <p>Description: "Horizon" embarks on a vivid exploration of Earth's diverse ecosystems, starting with the rich marine life beneath the seas and moving through the vital mangroves, showcasing the interconnectedness of these habitats. The journey begins with a dive into the ocean's depths to admire its fauna and seabeds, then transitions to the mangroves where the importance of these ecosystems is highlighted through the lives of pelicans on Farasan Island and flamingos, emphasizing conservation efforts like waste cleaning and reforestation. The narrative then shifts from the serene beauty of the Farasan Islands at sunset to the harsh desert landscape, home to gazelles, ostriches, and bustards, all part of a crucial reintroduction project. The film climbs into the mountains to reveal vultures, ibex, and monkeys, culminating with the Arabian leopard's struggle for survival and reintroduction efforts. The documentary concludes at King Abdullah's University for Science and Technology, where innovative 3D scanning techniques are used to preserve coral reefs, encapsulating the film's overarching theme of the critical need for preservation and reintroduction across the planet's varied ecosystems.—Forward Films (SA)</p>

                            <p>Description: A homeless veteran, Michael "Duffy" Duffield (Grillo), is always on the move, until he meets a talkative Ex-Con, Max Bomer (Phifer). Max notices Duffy's skills after he gets into a bar fight and offers him a well-paying job. Duffy agrees and discovers that the "job" is competing in underground fight clubs. The pair make a ton of money on the first fight and decide to travel to LA so Duffy can atone for his past and Max can pay back a crime boss, Sage Parker (Mulroney). They stay with Rachel, Max's sister, and Duffy quickly forms a connection with her. Duffy enters Sage's fight club and eventually wins, but it leads to unwanted attention. Duffy gets tied up in the crime world and offered jobs he can't refuse, including one with Sage's partner and Police officer, Ellen Ridgway. The deeper he goes in this world, the more deadly it gets. Duffy is a skilled fighter, but will he and Max make it out alive?—The Exchange company</p>

The spirit of this curse seems to have rubbed off somewhat on her longtime best friend Mya who is facing one disaster after another in her wedding preparations to her fiancé Raul. With Betty, she has a history of pulling away from any boyfriend on the slightest hint of any harm coming to him. Betty believes the stars already have it in for her when she is attracted to her new neighbor Alex in he going into the world's danger zones as a photojournalist. Beyond his job, Alex is a risk taker in wanting to live life to the fullest. As they spend more time together, Betty has to decide what to do in really liking him but not wanting to see any harm come to him.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Specializing in the works of Jane Austen, Dr. Eloise Cavendish is the keynote speaker at this year's Jane Austen League of America (JALA) conference and ball. This annual event is only the second time she's ever attended as, as an academic through and through, she doesn't much like the "ball" component, with many attendees treating JALA like one big Regency costume party. She doesn't even really see Austen, as most do, as a romance novelist in her rather clinical perspective. In addition to being able to visit with Mia Cavendish, her drama queen of a sister at the same time in Mia living in town, Eloise primarily accepted the invitation to meet and impress Dr. Victoria Jennings, one of the event organizers who is part of the hiring committee for a job at Princeton, a job Eloise would very much like. Unlike most, single Eloise is dismayed literally to meet "Mr. Darcy", he really Sam Lee, someone hired to dress and act like Mr. Darcy to provide some color to JALA. Her dismay is that Sam is doing double duty as her special guest liaison to JALA, including immersing her into what is somewhat expected of her in the "costume party" aspect. Eloise hates to admit that she needs Sam's help to impress Dr. Jennings, while she in turn helps him with a somewhat personal matter also associated to Dr. Jennings. The question becomes whether Eloise and Sam can bridge their differences in helping each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: "Horizon" embarks on a vivid exploration of Earth's diverse ecosystems, starting with the rich marine life beneath the seas and moving through the vital mangroves, showcasing the interconnectedness of these habitats. The journey begins with a dive into the ocean's depths to admire its fauna and seabeds, then transitions to the mangroves where the importance of these ecosystems is highlighted through the lives of pelicans on Farasan Island and flamingos, emphasizing conservation efforts like waste cleaning and reforestation. The narrative then shifts from the serene beauty of the Farasan Islands at sunset to the harsh desert landscape, home to gazelles, ostriches, and bustards, all part of a crucial reintroduction project. The film climbs into the mountains to reveal vultures, ibex, and monkeys, culminating with the Arabian leopard's struggle for survival and reintroduction efforts. The documentary concludes at King Abdullah's University for Science and Technology, where innovative 3D scanning techniques are used to preserve coral reefs, encapsulating the film's overarching theme of the critical need for preservation and reintroduction across the planet's varied ecosystems.—Forward Films (SA)</p>

                            <p>Description: Ana (Camila Mendes) is an ambitious intern, dreaming of a career in the art world while trying to impress her demanding boss, Claire (Marisa Tomei) the head of Erwins New York. Ana hopes to earn Claire's recommendation to work at a top art gallery in New York. Claire is a sociopath perfectionist.
Because of the expensive cost of living in New York, Ana currently lives with her sister Vivian (Aimee Carrero) and Vivian's boyfriend Ronnie (Andrew Schulz), who has been urging her to move out.
Amy (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) is Ana's only friend at the office. During an auction at work, Ana realizes there has been a typo in the auction's catalog mislabeling the type of paint used on a piece that is about to be sold. Ana informs Claire of the error just in time to make the correction, gaining her a little respect. Claire fires Billy, the person who was in charge of the catalog.
The next morning Claire invites Ana to serve as the assistant to her assistants on an upcoming work trip to London. Claire asks Ana to pack her bags and to come straight to the airport.Upset by Ana's ambition, Claire's two assistants Suzette (Rachel Matthews) and Renee (Fola Evans-Akingbola) wait until the group is boarding their flight to reveal that they have booked Ana an economy ticket for a flight that leaves 4 hours later. The ticket agent at the check-in desk witnesses this mistreatment and decides to upgrade Ana's ticket to first class. While waiting for her flight in the first-class lounge Ana distractedly answers a phone call and proceeds to spill her Bloody Mary on a wealthy man named William (Archie Renaux). Ana and William end up sitting next to each other on the flight to London and hit it off. During the flight, Ana accidentally leads William to believe she is the art director of her company's New York office. He is very impressed and when they land, introduces Ana to his mother, Catherine (Lena Olin), who is a British celebrity. Catherine is introduced to Ana, and she offers to drop Ana at her hotel.
Catherine and Ana hit it off and she even takes Ana's number to stay in touch.Suzette and Renee continue to sabotage Ana, assigning her an office in the basement and a room at a separate cheaper hotel, while they stay at the Carlson, a swanky hotel 4 streets from William's home.
Arnold (Thomas Kretschmann) is the head of the company and is leading the sale of the prestigious Brovil collection, whose owner is known only to Arnold. Arnold has brought in Gerard (head of Paris office) and Claire to overlook the sale and ensure its success. Arnold is due to retire, which means both Gerard and Claire are up for the top job.
Ana receives a voicemail informing her that she left her laptop in Williams's car. That night she goes to Catherine's house to retrieve her laptop and finds herself in the middle of a party. There she sees Catherine's extensive art collection (which belonged to her husband, who passed away), meets a famous painter, and continues to lie about being the director of a New York auction house named Erwins.
Ana tells Catherine that her husband was a romantic, since his art collection tells a story of love. Catherine reveals that she recently asked Erwins to auction her collection. Her last name is Brovil. Catherine says that she is working with Claire and says that she will ask Arnold to work with Ana instead. Ana says that the sale is a secret, and she would get in trouble if Arnold found out that she was talking to Catherine.Suzette and Renee are tasked with getting last-minute tickets to a performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while continuing to assign Ana to all of the work they don't want to do. Desperate to get tickets to impress Claire, Ana asks Catherine who leaves tickets with William. Ana visits William who is coaching an at-risk youth soccer league. William invites her to have lunch with him which she has to decline due to her workload. William also tells her that there is a party being thrown that evening and his mother, Catherine, wants Ana to attend. Before Ana leaves, Will clarifies that he would also like her to attend, as his date.Ana runs back to the London office and arrives just as Claire asks Suzette if she got the tickets. Suzette is forced to admit that she was not able to and is further embarrassed when Ana shows her up and turns in the tickets to Claire. Background tensions rise as Gerard (Gregory Montel), the art director for the Paris office, and Claire are both vying for the company's head director position.Ana attends the party, with William and Catherine, in a designer dress that she "borrowed" from Claire (Claire had given the dress to Ana for dry-cleaning). Catherine admits to Ana that she is having second thoughts about selling her collection, due to the love of her husband that it represents.
When she suddenly sees Claire arrive with Suzette and Renee, she is scared her lie will be revealed and attempts to run off. Will catches her before she leaves and instead takes her to go dancing at a local bar. At the end of the night, William wants to take Ana back to her hotel. Embarrassed by where she is actually staying, Ana has William drop her off at Claire's much nicer hotel and makes an excuse to prevent him from coming inside. Before leaving, William confesses that he is falling in love with her.Over the next week, Ana and William continue to spend time together, growing closer and developing their relationship. William tells Ana that he has spent his whole life being used by other people but that she is different, and he admires her for being down-to-earth and humble despite her wealth and success. He tells her he knows her job is important and that he has arranged to transfer his work to New York so that they can continue their relationship.At the office, Claire praises Ana's hard work and promises that there will be a promotion in her future. Renee interrupts their meeting to reveal that a major client has just pulled out of their upcoming auction. That client is Catherine, William's mother. At that same moment, William arrives to surprise Ana at work, and she rushes him out of the building. William tells Ana that he had nothing to do with his mother's decision and doesn't understand why she is acting so strange. He questions whether Ana was just using him to secure his mother's sale and breaks up with her.When Ana goes back into the building, she is confronted by Claire who has discovered her lie and her relationship with William's family. She is fired and escorted out of the building.Ana visits Catherine and confesses that she is not the successful art director she was pretending to be. Instead of being upset, Catherine is proud of Ana for her honesty. She says that she was also using Ana by pretending to walk away from the auction to get a better deal from Erwins who had offered her 85 million pounds for her collection.
Catherine agrees to rejoin the auction on the condition that Ana is the one who handles the sale. Ana kicks Gerard off the auction and puts Claire in total control. Ana is re-hired and manages to sell Catherine's art for much more than expected (250 million pounds). She goes back to the soccer field and apologizes to William who tells her that he didn't like her because she was rich, he liked her because he thought she was an honest person.Ana returns to New York and six months later she has not heard from William but is thriving in her career. Ana throws a party to celebrate the opening of her own art gallery. At the end of the night, after everyone else has left, William arrives with a suitcase.</p>

                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's (Jennifer Lopez) opinions on love and romance. Alida and Taroo tried to hide their love, but Alida's father found out. She was ordered to marry another from her own tribe. She prayed to the Gods to be rescued, who turn her into a red flower. Taroo begged the Gods to help him find Alida, and they turned him into a hummingbird.Artist reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover (Ben Affleck). Artist always wanted to be in love. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured. With the help of factory workers (the cells within her own body), she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide, but to no avail ("Hearts and Flowers").Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist (Fat Joe). He finds her dreams to be eccentric, which she blames on the conflicting astrological signs between him and his wife.The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra (Gilbert Saldivar); she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being ("Rebound").
Artists friends are The Cynic, The Idealist (Ashley Versher), The Realist (Malcolm Kelner), The Lover (Brandon Delsid), The Quiet One (Alix Angelis) and The Fighter (Danielle Larracuente).She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs (Aries (Jay Shetty), Taurus (Neil DeGrasse Tyson), Gemini (Jenifer Lewis), Cancer (Sofía Vergara), Leo (Post Malone), Virgo (Kim Petras), Libra (Trevor Noah), Scorpio (Keke Palmer), Sagittarius (Jane Fonda), Pisces (Sadhguru)), questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions.
Before they could piece together an answer, Artist enters three unsuccessful marriages with a Pisces (Tony Bellissimo), a Virgo (Derek Hough), and a Cancer (Trevor Jackson), respectively ("Can't Get Enough").The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance.
While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention. They believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices.
In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. Artist says that she believes in true love and that good things happen to good people.
Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story ("Broken Like Me"). Artist admits that she fears that she might be the reason behind her broken relationships.Artist returns home and burns old love letters and childhood memories while a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window.
As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike/The Cynic (Matthew Law), a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her.During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored ("This Is Me... Now"). Artist proves to herself that she only needs to love herself for her to be complete. The power of her conviction releases an energy that shoots off into the Universe and hits a bell at the Zodiacal council.With a new lease on life, Artist attends Mike's wedding alone and encounters several hummingbirds that lead her to her true love ("Midnight Trip to Vegas", "Hummingbird").</p>

Duffy gets tied up in the crime world and offered jobs he can't refuse, including one with Sage's partner and Police officer, Ellen Ridgway. The deeper he goes in this world, the more deadly it gets.

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's (Jennifer Lopez) opinions on love and romance. Alida and Taroo tried to hide their love, but Alida's father found out. She was ordered to marry another from her own tribe. She prayed to the Gods to be rescued, who turn her into a red flower. Taroo begged the Gods to help him find Alida, and they turned him into a hummingbird.Artist reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover (Ben Affleck). Artist always wanted to be in love. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured. With the help of factory workers (the cells within her own body), she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide, but to no avail ("Hearts and Flowers").Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist (Fat Joe). He finds her dreams to be eccentric, which she blames on the conflicting astrological signs between him and his wife.The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra (Gilbert Saldivar); she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being ("Rebound").
Artists friends are The Cynic, The Idealist (Ashley Versher), The Realist (Malcolm Kelner), The Lover (Brandon Delsid), The Quiet One (Alix Angelis) and The Fighter (Danielle Larracuente).She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs (Aries (Jay Shetty), Taurus (Neil DeGrasse Tyson), Gemini (Jenifer Lewis), Cancer (Sofía Vergara), Leo (Post Malone), Virgo (Kim Petras), Libra (Trevor Noah), Scorpio (Keke Palmer), Sagittarius (Jane Fonda), Pisces (Sadhguru)), questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions.
Before they could piece together an answer, Artist enters three unsuccessful marriages with a Pisces (Tony Bellissimo), a Virgo (Derek Hough), and a Cancer (Trevor Jackson), respectively ("Can't Get Enough").The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance.
While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention. They believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices.
In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. Artist says that she believes in true love and that good things happen to good people.
Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story ("Broken Like Me"). Artist admits that she fears that she might be the reason behind her broken relationships.Artist returns home and burns old love letters and childhood memories while a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window.
As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike/The Cynic (Matthew Law), a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her.During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored ("This Is Me... Now"). Artist proves to herself that she only needs to love herself for her to be complete. The power of her conviction releases an energy that shoots off into the Universe and hits a bell at the Zodiacal council.With a new lease on life, Artist attends Mike's wedding alone and encounters several hummingbirds that lead her to her true love ("Midnight Trip to Vegas", "Hummingbird").</p>

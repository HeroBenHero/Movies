                            <p>Description: Amanda Raymond moved back to her family's flower farm after her father Craig Raymond's passing a year ago. That milestone not only was to help her mother Grace Raymond run the farm, but led to her turning her back on the church for God taking her father away from them. Amanda and Grace are facing problems this Easter season, one of their most economically profitable seasons of the year, with the unseasonable cold weather meaning no flowers yet. Behind on the mortgage payment, they are at risk of losing the farm, Craig's legacy. While Craig was the floral designer in the family, Amanda, who has no training or natural ability at such, works toward a Hail Mary in planning to enter the annual Easter statewide flower arranging competition, the $20,000 first prize which would tie them over financially. The only reason why Amanda is considering it is because Lori Matthews, a trained now retired florist who has just moved to town and who Amanda helped out of a bind in their first meeting, has offered to be her teacher. Many of Lori's lessons take them away from the floral table, sometimes to the church where her son Derrick Matthews is the new pastor, that initial entrance back into the church still being a painful one for Amanda. Both Lori and Derrick are facing their own demons, one which Lori may have to face in moving to town, and one Derrick has run away from in moving to town. In the process of the floral competition, their collective issues may come to a head as Amanda and Derrick start to fall for each other.â€”Huggo</p>

One day, Oliwia got a call from her village, situated in the Podlaskie province, and she was informed that her grandmother had passed away. She asked her boss for a leave and rushed to her village immediately, as she knew that she was the only family member her grandmother had.
Oliwia's mother and grandmother used to fight all the time, and as a result, Oliwia never stayed a lot with her grandmother as her mother went off to live on the other side of the world.
Oliwia grew to up be a girl with a hot temper and no patience.Oliwia got the shock of her life when she realized that it was all an act, and her grandmother was pretty much alive. Her grandmother, Halina (Anna Seniuk), had lied to her, saying she wanted Oliwia to come back to the village and stay with her. Oliwia got mad at first, but then she realized that her grandmother missed her way too much. Oliwia's car was broken down (most probably it was messed up by one of the villagers to prompt Oliwia to stay the night).
Halina says that it was Oliwia's mother who turned her against her grandmother.
Still, Oliwia knew that she would go back in a couple of days, but she had no clue about what Halina had in her mind. She went missing just a day before Oliwia's departure, and she left a note for the latter, telling her that she was leaving her farm in her care. The farm had a horse named Dumpling which was bought for Oliwia when it was a colt.Oliwia was stuck, and additionally, she didn't know how to manage an entire farm. Luckily, she met a man who told her that he was Wojtek (Mateusz Janicki), the caretaker who generally provided a helping hand to Halina. Oliwia was glad that she found someone on whom she could put all the responsibilities and leave, but she had no clue that the entire village was conspiring together with Halina.
Oliwia meets her childhood friend Matylda Wasyl (Angelika Cegielska-Swiatek), and they used to go apple picking together. Matylda is with the local police and tells Oliwia that Halina is alive and well and is using the internet at Matylda's house to keep tabs on Oliwia.Eventually, Oliwia starts riding Dumpling and enjoying the farm life. Wojtek even fixes her car. Oliwia bonds with her farm animals when a recently born baby goat got sick and really weak. Oliwia had to feed the baby goat by herself to save her life.
The town had many colorful characters including 2 brothers who brewed their own moonshine. Oliwia suggests them to mix their flavors to create an even more amazing brew.Everybody knew that Halina was hiding in Jan's (Artur Barcis) house, but no one informed Oliwia about it, as they, too, wanted her to stay back with her grandmother. The man who said he was Wojtek was actually the owner of the Herbal World, and his real name was Kuba Wolak. Kuba made sure that Olivia's car didn't start the next day, hoping that it would coerce her to stay back.Although Oliwia was annoyed when her car didn't start, she decided to see the brighter side of things. She knew she had a hectic life in the city, and she realized that it wouldn't be such a bad thing to stay back and take some downtime. Halina was happy that her plan was working, and she wished and hoped that her granddaughter would stay there for good.
Oliwia gets a hang of farm work, including the milking of goats. Matylda comes by and convinces her to take a longer vacation from work. Her boss is distraught but gives her another week.Now, firstly, Kuba had lied about his identity, and secondly, Oliwia got to know that he was an arch-nemesis of her grandmother. Oliwia got to know that, first, Kuba and his father had filed a suit against her grandmother for the damages (to tune of 25,000 Zlotys) caused to their business.
Oliwia's mother had sold their meadow to Kuba's father, and this is what Halina and Oliwia's mother fought about, as the meadow was sold without Halina's consent.
Oliwia realizes that man she thought was Wojtek is really Kuba. She had gone with an offer to sell the entire farm for 150,000 Zoltys, but Kuba tells Oliwia that Halina can earn that money from the farm to pay of her debts.Oliwia realized that maybe Kuba was a monopolist, and he was envious of the fact that Halina's cheese production business was doing so well. Halina won awards every year for her product, and it was said that her cheese was the best in the entire region. This is when the health department had come for inspection at Halina's farm, and after that, they had put a ban on the production of cheese.Halina's cheese was of the best quality, and it felt like either the health inspector had a grudge against her, or somebody had bribed him or used their influence to destroy Halina's business. The suspicion fell on Kuba, as he was the one who had these legal battles going on. Kuba had fallen for Oliwia, and he wanted to tell her that he was not the person she believed him to be. Kuba tried telling Oliwia that it was all a big misunderstanding. He told her that he had not called the health department, and in fact, it was Halina who had filed a complaint against him at first.Kuba had separated from his wife sometime back, and his girl stayed with him. Kuba wanted things to work out between him and Oliwia, and so one day, on the advice of his daughter, he decided to express his feelings to her. Oliwia also liked Kuba, but the fact was that she was never going to stay in the village, and a long-distance relationship was something that she felt was not doable.
Kuba tried to approach Oliwia, but he was stopped by Halina's friends who did not want Oliwia mixing up with Halina's arch-nemesis.
Oliwia restarts making cheese from goat milk, using Halina's recipe. The first batch is only so-so. Kuba's daughter comes by and suggests that Oliwia can improve the taste using herbs from Kuba's herb garden. Oliwia becomes best friends with Kuba's daughter and learns that Kuba is in love with her.Over a period of time, Kuba realized that not only did he have a strong bond with Oliwia on a personal level, but they were also too good when it came to professional partnerships. One time, people from Warsaw were coming to meet Kuba as they saw potential in his herb world initiative, and they wanted to invest money in the new venture that he was going to open in Bialystok. At the last moment, Kuba realized that his father had fired the chef and there was nobody to cook food for them. He asked Oliwia to help him out, and considering she was a professional chef, she made the most delicious lunch for the guests. The Varsovians were impressed, and they decided to invest money in Kuba's venture.When Halina came back from hiding, she got to know that it was a lady named Maryla Jura (Beata Kawka) who had snitched and informed the health department.
Halina accepted Kuba and Oliwia's relationship, as she knew that there was a possibility that because of Kuba, Oliwia might stay back. But Oliwia was a practical girl, and she decided that her life was in the city. She had huge dreams, and so to fulfill them once again, with tears in her eyes, she went back.
Kuba stood there on his farm, watching Oliwia drive her car away. He wanted to stop her; he wanted to tell her how much he needed her in his life, but he knew that he couldn't do that. Kuba knew that their relationship wouldn't be sustainable if he forced her to stay. Kuba wanted her to get the realization, and he was prepared that probably she wouldn't ever return to the village.But something happened to Oliwia once she got back to her city. She felt a void inside her, and she just couldn't focus on anything.
Yes, her career was there, but there was nobody around her whom she could call her own. She craved her grandmother's presence; she longed to be with Kuba, and she felt deprived of that warmth that she got there from everybody else.That's when Oliwia decided to go back to her village. It was a tough decision for her, but she was very clear about her priorities. In the end, Kuba was elated when he found that Oliwia had come back, and he just couldn't stop blushing when he heard the hooves of her horse approaching him. Halina got what she wanted, and probably in the future, Oliwia wouldn't have to compromise on her career, and she would take her grandmother's home-grown business to greater heights.</p>

                            <p>Description: Sister Mary sneaks into a superior's bedroom at night and steals a ring of keys to escape through the locked gates of the Roman Catholic convent. She is captured and knocked unconscious by four hooded figures. She later wakes up in a coffin and is buried alive.Sister Cecilia turned to Christianity at a young age after she nearly drowned in a frozen lake and was declared dead for seven minutes, convinced that God had saved her for a purpose. She receives an invitation from Father Sal Tedeschi to join a convent in Italy that tends to dying nuns in their last days. Cecilia takes vows to adhere to the evangelical counsels and becomes a nun, being decorated with a rosary.She befriends Sister Gwen and is struck by certain oddities, such as an elder nun having scars on her feet in the shape of crosses. The convent's chapel houses what they claim is a Holy Nail relic that was taken from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. Cecilia is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, even though she is a virgin and has never had relations with a man. The convent's inhabitants begin to treat her as the next Virgin Mary, with many proclaiming the child is a "blessing".Another nun, Sister Isabelle, tries to drown Cecilia out of jealousy, saying that it "should have been her." Cecilia throws up one of her own teeth and her health worsens. Her request to be taken to a proper hospital is denied by Father Tedeschi. Isabelle dies after falling off the convent's roof as Cecilia is walking through the cloister. Gwen publicly chastises the convent superiors for turning a blind eye but is then bundled away by Father Tedeschi and Deacon Enzo.At night, Cecilia notices that behind a painting of the Virgin Mary in her room, another nun had inscribed 2 Corinthians 11:14 on the wall, a hidden warning causing her to realize that something is wrong about this convent. Cecilia breaks open a drawer to read her file and is shocked to find information on the accident in her childhood. Hearing a woman screaming, she ventures further and is horrified to witness a hooded figure cutting out Gwen's tongue. An elder nun appears and silences Cecilia. She begs to escape but the elder chastises her, saying no one ever leaves the convent.She tries to escape the convent by faking a miscarriage using a dead chicken, but the deception is exposed. She attempts to run before being forcibly brought back by Tedeschi and Enzo. Tedeschi explains that he was a geneticist before becoming a priest and used DNA samples taken from the Holy Nail relic to impregnate nuns in the hopes of ushering in a new messiah. Until his success with Cecilia, Tedeschi's numerous attempts failed, often resulting in malformed fetuses. Tedeschi brands a cross into Cecilia's foot, a symbol also on many of the other nuns.Cecilia makes another attempt to escape. She beats Mother Superior to death using a crucifix, and shortly after, her water breaks. She manages to strangle the cardinal with her rosary before dousing Tedeschi's lab in ethanol. Tedeschi arrives and tries to stop her through physical force, but Cecilia narrowly escapes by igniting the ethanol with a lighter.Tedeschi manages to break out of the laboratory after extinguishing the flames and continues his pursuit against Cecilia, forcing her to flee into the catacombs under the convent. Cecilia finds Gwen's mutilated corpse along with a hole in the catacombs walls. Tedeschi finds her just as she is about to escape and a struggle ensues. Tedeschi tries to cut Cecilia's stomach open, but she stabs him in the throat with the Holy Nail relic, which she had previously stolen from the chapel. After exiting the catacombs, Cecilia agonizingly gives birth and bites through the umbilical cord herself. She is clearly horrified by the sight of the "baby", which is heard making gurgling and growling noises, while gasping for air. Cecilia stumbles away to grab and lift a nearby rock, which she uses to crush the experiment.</p>

                            <p>Description: Johnny (Peter Butler) and Zuko (Bonko Khoza) were members of a group of armed activists called Alkebulan, determined to eradicate corruption in South Africa. Johnny was once a popular lawyer and the Director of International Relations, but when Daza Mtima (Sisanda Henna) was released from prison and gained power, Johnny got repeatedly demoted. Clearly, Johnny's stance did not align with Mtima's. He started a counterintelligence operation with elite assassins to take down Mtima, and Zuko was one of them.Zuko was born to activist parents and had grown up to always voice for the right cause. He had taken an oath during his initiation in which he promised to fight for justice and to protect the innocent. Johnny Klein found hope when he got access to files that exposed Mtima. Johnny trusted Zuko to ensure that Mtima was not exonerated by the courts, even though it had been a long time since Zuko had left the group.Johnny was diagnosed with cancer, and he had Mtima's PIA agents (reporting into Mo) tracking his every movement. However, Johnny managed to escape an attack when the PIA agents tracked the wrong person. Agent Naledi was on point for intel on Johnny's location.
Mtima is planning to fight an election and puts pressure on Mo to deliver Johnny to him.Johnny knew that he was running out of time, and the truth would be buried with him if Mtima found him before he could connect with Zuko. With time running out, Johnny met Zuko at his workplace. This meeting was observed by PIA agents. Zuko was not ready to leave behind the beautiful life he had built and endanger the future he envisioned with girlfriend Malime (and their son Pakamile), but he had a change of heart upon finding out that Johnny was suffering from a terminal illness.
Johnny handed him the key to the locker at the airport and instructed Zuko to head to Maseru, where he would find elders to show him the right path. Johnny distracted the PIA agents, while Zuko headed to the airport. Just when the agents thought they had succeeded in cornering Johnny, he shot himself and simultaneously jumped off the highway. Johnny had done his part for the welfare of South Africa. He had assigned Zuko the task of bringing out the truth, and he had also contacted Cape Town Sentinel journalist Mike Bressler (Deon Coetzee), whose career Mtima had ruined during his investigation into the state capture.Zuko had no choice but to bid goodbye to Malime (Masasa Mbangeni), knowing that their lives would be at risk if he continued to stay in touch with them. Malime never questioned Zuko about his past, but she could guess that he was in trouble when Johnny knocked at their door. Zuko chose not to disclose much about his life as an assassin, and when he suddenly decided to leave Malime was left wondering if he was just like all the other men who promised her the world but failed to live up to it.
Pakamile (Boleng Mogotsi) and Zuko shared a beautiful relationship, and he looked up to Zuko. He was the only one who knew that Zuko planned on proposing Malime and when he left all of a sudden, Pakamile did not lose hope. He had complete faith in Zuko and he was confident that he would return to their lives.
At the airport locker, Zuko found a passport and an flight ticket to Maseru.The PIA agents arrived at Malime's house and forcefully dragged her out. They wanted to find out more about the files Johnny had, and they believed that kidnapping Malime would help them stop Zuko. Malime barely had any knowledge about her partner's criminal past, but she tried to cooperate in the hopes of getting back to Pakamile.
Naledi (Nicole Fortuin), who was a member of the radical activist group, had infiltrated the PIA. Zuko contacted Naledi after he embarked on the mission. She advised him to focus on the task while she tried to find a way to make sure that his partner remained safe. She got in touch with Malime and tried to give her some hope.Unfortunately, Mo got a whiff of Naledi's true identity and interrogated her. Naledi refused to give away any information, and she was taken away to be further tortured. Mo was unaware of how skilled a fighter Naledi was, and it was only a matter of minutes before she managed to tackle the guards.
Naledi assisted Malime in escaping, but the entire situation was too overwhelming for Malime. The chaos and confusion resulted in Malime failing to land after jumping off a building to save her life. Malime did not survive the fall, and Mo decided to kidnap Pakamile to keep Zuko under pressure. Pakamile was in extreme pain after losing his mother all of a sudden and being locked up in a tiny room without any contact with his loved ones.
After escaping Naledi contacted Bressler. Naledi tells Bressler that Johhny and Zuko were running a counterintelligence operation against Mtima with elite assassins. She says that Malime died due to Mo.The Director of the PIA (Presidential Intelligence Agency), Molebogeng Kwena (Connie Ferguson), found out that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Thandiwe Makeba (Connie Chiume), was also involved with Johnny and his group. The connection between Makeba and Johnny was something Mo was keen on finding out.
She was surprised to learn that Mtima knew about Makeba's involvement, and he also had incriminating evidence against the former minister for her involvement in illegal mining. But even with the evidence against her, Makeba continued to be a threat to Mtima, and Mo was instructed to silence her. She had no choice but to obey Mtima because of her tainted past- her father was closely involved with the apartheid regime. Mo met Makeba to find out about Johnny's plan, but all the former politician disclosed was that Mtima would lose everything he had built by Friday.Thandi believed that it was her duty to protect South Africa from people like Mtima, who would not mind selling the nation for their own benefit. She and Johnny had created a deadly weapon, Zuko, to ensure that the innocent would not suffer from injustice. Thandi hoped for Mo to side with the cause after finding out about their pure intention, but it was all too late for Mo; she was already knee-deep in helping Mtima. Mo struck Thandi with a blunt object, and the former minister bled to death.Zuko felt reconnected with his ancestors when he reached Maseru and met the elders at the village. They tended to his wounds and handed him the letter Johnny had left for him. Zuko was reminded of the cause he was fighting for and how it was greater than everything else. He found the files Johnny had promised, and before releasing them to the public, he burned down the file of Alkebulan.
Just when Zuko accepted his role in the grand scheme of things, Mo informed him how every member of the group had been compromised. Zuko was furious when he found out that Malime met with an accident and Pakamile was kidnapped. He realized that the only way to stop Mtima was by exposing him, and he contacted Mike Bressler to hand over the files Johnny had left. They secretly met at a restaurant, and before handing over the documents, Zuko laid forth a condition: he was desperate to be reunited with his family, and he hoped for Bressler to help him.Bressler helped Zuko connect with Naledi, and it was from her that he found out about Malime's death. Zuko realized that before destroying Mtima, it was important that he get his son back. Naledi had been keeping track of Mo, and she had located a cabin she frequented. Bressler recognized the cabin; it was where Mtima lived when he visited Cape Town. Zuko broke into Mtima's cabin to seek his ultimate revenge.With the spear handed to him by his elders, Zuko slayed Mtima's guards one after the other. Mtima was easy to knock out, and by the time he came back to his senses, Zuko had his spear pressed on Mtima's throat. The presidential hopeful was well aware that Zuko was desperate to get his son back, and he knew that he would not be harmed as long as he had Pakamile. Zuko instructed Mo to get his son back, and in the meantime, Mtima tried to lure Zuko with money.Mtima's PIA agents arrived at the cabin, and what followed was an intense fight where Zuko triumphed. Mo brought along Pakamile to stop Zuko and force him to hand over the files. Zuko explained that he had already handed over the files for printing, and Mtima's political career was over. Mo was holding a gun, and she pointed it at Zuko. Mtima encouraged her to shoot him dead and prove to the world that she was not a traitor like her father. Mo crossed all boundaries, fearing being publicly shamed for her father's association with the apartheid regime, but she realized that as long as Mtima lived, there would never be an end to her misery.Mo shoots Mtima dead. She wanted to kill Zuko as well, but Naledi came to his rescue. Mo was shot dead, and it was all over for Mtima and his supporters.
The next morning, the murders of Daza Mtima and Molebogeng Kwena made it to the headlines. There were officially no suspects, suggesting that Zuko and Naledi had managed to walk away Scot-free. The files Johnny had gathered made it to the public, and those involved in the State capture were apprehended. While some sense of justice was brought into the world, Zuko headed back to his childhood home at the Great Fish River with his son by his side. He wanted to live a life of a recluse and dedicate all his time to farming, just like he and Pakamile had always planned.</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers. In the process, the two start to fall for each other. What happens between them is affected by the fate of the book in the club which may inadvertently impact the store.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Sister Mary sneaks into a superior's bedroom at night and steals a ring of keys to escape through the locked gates of the Roman Catholic convent. She is captured and knocked unconscious by four hooded figures. She later wakes up in a coffin and is buried alive.Sister Cecilia turned to Christianity at a young age after she nearly drowned in a frozen lake and was declared dead for seven minutes, convinced that God had saved her for a purpose. She receives an invitation from Father Sal Tedeschi to join a convent in Italy that tends to dying nuns in their last days. Cecilia takes vows to adhere to the evangelical counsels and becomes a nun, being decorated with a rosary.She befriends Sister Gwen and is struck by certain oddities, such as an elder nun having scars on her feet in the shape of crosses. The convent's chapel houses what they claim is a Holy Nail relic that was taken from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. Cecilia is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, even though she is a virgin and has never had relations with a man. The convent's inhabitants begin to treat her as the next Virgin Mary, with many proclaiming the child is a "blessing".Another nun, Sister Isabelle, tries to drown Cecilia out of jealousy, saying that it "should have been her." Cecilia throws up one of her own teeth and her health worsens. Her request to be taken to a proper hospital is denied by Father Tedeschi. Isabelle dies after falling off the convent's roof as Cecilia is walking through the cloister. Gwen publicly chastises the convent superiors for turning a blind eye but is then bundled away by Father Tedeschi and Deacon Enzo.At night, Cecilia notices that behind a painting of the Virgin Mary in her room, another nun had inscribed 2 Corinthians 11:14 on the wall, a hidden warning causing her to realize that something is wrong about this convent. Cecilia breaks open a drawer to read her file and is shocked to find information on the accident in her childhood. Hearing a woman screaming, she ventures further and is horrified to witness a hooded figure cutting out Gwen's tongue. An elder nun appears and silences Cecilia. She begs to escape but the elder chastises her, saying no one ever leaves the convent.She tries to escape the convent by faking a miscarriage using a dead chicken, but the deception is exposed. She attempts to run before being forcibly brought back by Tedeschi and Enzo. Tedeschi explains that he was a geneticist before becoming a priest and used DNA samples taken from the Holy Nail relic to impregnate nuns in the hopes of ushering in a new messiah. Until his success with Cecilia, Tedeschi's numerous attempts failed, often resulting in malformed fetuses. Tedeschi brands a cross into Cecilia's foot, a symbol also on many of the other nuns.Cecilia makes another attempt to escape. She beats Mother Superior to death using a crucifix, and shortly after, her water breaks. She manages to strangle the cardinal with her rosary before dousing Tedeschi's lab in ethanol. Tedeschi arrives and tries to stop her through physical force, but Cecilia narrowly escapes by igniting the ethanol with a lighter.Tedeschi manages to break out of the laboratory after extinguishing the flames and continues his pursuit against Cecilia, forcing her to flee into the catacombs under the convent. Cecilia finds Gwen's mutilated corpse along with a hole in the catacombs walls. Tedeschi finds her just as she is about to escape and a struggle ensues. Tedeschi tries to cut Cecilia's stomach open, but she stabs him in the throat with the Holy Nail relic, which she had previously stolen from the chapel. After exiting the catacombs, Cecilia agonizingly gives birth and bites through the umbilical cord herself. She is clearly horrified by the sight of the "baby", which is heard making gurgling and growling noises, while gasping for air. Cecilia stumbles away to grab and lift a nearby rock, which she uses to crush the experiment.</p>

                            <p>Description: The film opens with a young Robert Nesta Marley (Nolan Collignon) joining his mother as they take a bus from one home to another. This is followed by text explaining how Bob Marley is still known today as Jamaica's biggest star. He grew up from humble beginnings around a time of violence in Jamaica during the 70s after the nation gained its independence from Great Britain.Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), already well into his career, goes to a press conference after announcing that he is planning to hold a peace concert, "Smile Jamaica", to unite the nation in the face of political discourse. Some critics fear that Bob is making it look like his is taking a side.Kingston, 1976 - Bob is playing soccer with his friends and sons when thugs start firing their guns in the streets. Bob protects his sons and takes them away, telling them not to worry about what happened (this is also where he starts to come up with "Three Little Birds"). They return to their home, where Bob talks to his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch), as the constant threat of violence around their family puts her on edge.Later, Bob goes to rehearse "I Shot The Sheriff" with his group, The Wailers. Rita steps out momentarily and sees two gunmen running towards the house, while a third aims his gun at her head. The two men enter the house and shoot at Bob and his friend Don Taylor (Anthony Welsh), while Rita has also been shot. Despite his injury, Bob rises to his feet and gets Don and Rita to the hospital. Bob sits by Rita's bedside as she lies unconscious. He reminisces about when they were teenagers (played by Quan-Dajai Henrique and Nia Ashi) and Bob began to court Rita.Following their recoveries, Bob still plans on going forward with the concert. Everyone close to him sees it as a bad idea for his safety and his family's, but he insists on doing it. On the night of the show, Bob goes and performs, but he briefly hallucinates seeing the gunman that shot him in the crowd. He then stops the show and reveals his injuries to the crowd before walking off the stage. Rita tries to comfort him, and Bob says he needs time to himself.Three months later, Bob travels to London with some of his friends. While there, they are arrested for possession of cannabis. In jail, Bob recalls how Rita first brought him into the Rastafari movement. He also thinks about witnessing his father abandon him and his mother when he was a child, and he refused to acknowledge Bob as his son.Later, Bob talks to his producer Chris Blackwell (James Norton) over ideas for a new album. Rita joins him in London while Bob and the Wailers are trying to come up with a new sound. Bob listens to the soundtrack to the film "Exodus" and starts to come up with his own song of the same name. With help from publicist Howard Bloom (Michael Gandolfini), the group makes their next album, "Exodus", which becomes a worldwide best-selling hit.Following the album's success, Bob goes on a tour throughout Europe in 1977. Although he sees much more success and popularity, Bob is seen engaging in an affair with a woman, Cindy Breakspeare (Umi Myers). During a pickup game of soccer, Bob is seen stumbling after an injury, but he brushes it off.Chris invites Bob and company to an event. While there, Bob gets jealous at seeing Rita talking to another man. When he goes outside to confront her, she in turn hits back at him with the knowledge of his own multiple affairs and the children he has produced as a result. Rita slaps Bob and also tells him to keep an eye out for Don, as he is doing some shady businesses behind Bob's back.After another show, Bob confronts Don backstage over what Rita told him. He begins to physically attack Don before his band mates and Rita pull Bob off of him.Not long after, Bob visits a doctor after Rita and Chris express concerns over a dark spot on Bob's toe where he injured himself during the pickup game. The doctor informs Bob that he has melanoma, and while it was recommended that he have the toe removed to stop the cancer from spreading, Bob declines and is left in a state of despair over the news. He talks to Rita, who gives him her own little speech and inspires him to return home to Jamaica.1978 - Bob makes his return to Jamaica, with a huge crowd gathering for him as the plane lands. Bob visits his old home, which is now empty. The same gunman that shot him enters the house, asking Bob for forgiveness. Bob says he holds no vengeance in his heart. Later, Bob sits with Rita and their sons around a campfire as he comes up with "Redemption Song". Rita says that Bob is ready to perform again.Bob and the Wailers later get ready as they gather for a large crowd in Jamaica for a new show. He then gets up to perform "One Love".Ending text states that Bob Marley passed away on May 11, 1981 from his cancer. However, footage is shown from his One Love Concert where he brought together leaders of opposing political parties as a symbol of unity. It is also stated that Time Magazine called "Exodus" one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

While it has led to countless one-night stands over the years, following their playbook comes with a strict set of ground rules - chief among them: you can't build a relationship from a play. When Mack unexpectedly falls for her latest target, charming war correspondent Nick (Tom Ellis), she begins to rethink the game entirely. As the lines between work, fun, friendship, and romance begin to blur, Mack must learn what it takes to go from simply scoring to playing for keeps.â€”Netflix</p>

                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: In-between jobs, New York City fashion psychologist Lauren Elliott accepts short term work for her best friend Charlotte Gauthier's new boss, neurotic and high strung Virgil St-James, the successful head designer at Lavigne, a Paris fashion house, in the lead up to the debut of Virgil's latest collection at Paris Fashion Week. Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Girls from a shelter home in Munawwarpur are pimped out, and if something goes wrong, they are killed and cremated. The shelter home is run by Bansi, and his assistant is Sonu, who takes care of the operational details.When Vaishali (Bhumi Pednekar) was handed the social audit report by her informer, she thought it was useless material. She did not believe she had the power to stop the abuse that the girls at the shelter home in Munawwarpur were subjected to. Guptaji (Durgesh Kumar) was quite persistent about the case, and Vaishali took an interest when he mentioned that the police had not taken any action even though it had been two months since the report had been published. Vaishali started to investigate the case. Vaishali needs a strong story to keep her channel alive, else she will lose all viewers, and with it all sources of income.As soon as Vaishali started investigating, Bansi Sahu's (Aditya Srivastava) name cropped up too often. She meets Mithilesh Sinha, the head of Child Welfare Commission who says that he has no such information about the audit.
Sahu, a journalist himself, had a huge influence in the village of Munawwarpur. He contacted Vaishali's husband, Arvind (Surya Sharma), the minute he figured out that a journalist was inquiring about the shelter home. He indirectly threatened Vaishali to back off, but it instead intrigued her interest all the more.
Vaishali soon learned that Bansi Sahu had the support of the government. He bought printing papers at a subsidized rate but barely printed three copies. It was a daylight scam, and no one dared to question him. The shelter home belonged to him, and he was also associated with various other NGOs.
All the shelter homes of the state come under the purview of Ministry of Social Welfare, headed by Rajni Singh.
Everyone was afraid of Bansi Sahu, and the Chief Minister Jitesh Kumar (Anand Sharma) was also within his reach. Vaishali's mentor and cameraman, Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra), was a little shaken upon realizing that they would be challenging the government if they decided to expose the abuse and sex racket. Vaishali decided to continue with her investigation and find evidence that would support the claims made in the report.It was almost impossible to find anyone who could provide information about the Munawwarpur shelter home. They tried their best to track down anyone who had been relocated from the Munawwarpur shelter, but they remained unsuccessful. After inquiring at several shelter homes, they finally found hope at one where the cook previously worked at the Munawwarpur shelter home. When Vaishali and Bhaskar introduced themselves, Sudha (Tanisha Mehta) refused to utter a word. She denied knowing or seeing anything unlawful during her time there. Vaishali gave up and was about to leave when Sudha decided to confess the truth under one condition: she was not ready to go on record, and she did not want her name associated with the case.Sudha spoke about her haunting memories at the shelter home. She brought up Baby Rani (Gulista Alija), the shelter warden, and how she mistreated the girls. She used to force the girls to sleep naked while she assaulted them. The 40-45 girls at the shelter had only one room to sleep in, and their health condition was extremely poor.
One of the girls advised Sudha to run for her life, and she soon figured out the reason behind it. They had a doctor who took care of cases where the victims were injured to an extreme degree. Later, Sudha watched Bansi and his men party (including Mithilesh) at the shelter home, and they abused and tortured the girls at random. She realized she, too, would meet the same fate and decided to run away that very night. Before leaving, she heard Baby Rani and Sonu (Satyakam Anand) mention killing a girl they had pimped out.
The details left Vaishali and Bhaskar speechless. They were all the more determined to expose the perpetrators and rescue the victims. The only problem was that the only witness Vaishali had was not willing to come forward. She soon realized that even though there was a lack of evidence, she had to act confidently to force the abusers to react, and that would eventually lead to one blunder or another.When Vaishali learned that a PIL had been filed against the Munawwarpur shelter home, she assumed her brother-in-law, lawyer Suresh Singh (Danish Iqbal), was behind it. Suresh was completely against Vaishali's decision to look into Bansi Sahu's business. He always looked down upon the work she did, especially because she did not fit into the typical idea of a 'good Indian housewife.' Bansi's men also thought that Suresh was responsible for the PIL, and they roughed him up to teach Vaishali a lesson. Surprisingly, Arvind showed confidence in the work Vaishali had undertaken, and now that she had his support, it was impossible to deter her from exposing the criminals.Vaishali decided to constantly update her audience about the case, and she discussed the torture Suresh was subjected to and how the police refused to file an FIR against Bansi Sahu. Vaishali's small endeavor all of a sudden caught the attention of the common people as well as the influential. She approached the first female SSP of Munawwarpur, Jasmeet Gaur (Sai Tamhankar), to seek help. While Jasmeet was hopeful that she would find a solution, her senior advised her to stay out of it because of the lack of evidence in the case. The next time Jasmeet and Vaishali met, she helped her understand the importance of putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department. Only after Social Welfare Department files in FIR, can the Police do anything.
Meanwhile, it is revealed that it was Guptaji who filed the PIL in Patna High Court.Brijmohan Singh's (Pravin Kumar Sisodia) wife, Rajni Singh (Vibha Chibbar), headed the Social Welfare Department, but he was the one who made all decisions on her behalf. Brijmohan was one of Bansi's many clients, and they maintained a close relationship.
Vaishali realized that the only way she could put pressure on the Social Welfare Department was with believable lies. Bhaskar Sinha was assigned the task of pretending to be a well-wisher of Brijmohan. He managed to meet the politician and warned him of the evidence Vaishali had gathered against him and his wife. To instigate a misunderstanding between Bansi and his men, Bhaskar mentioned that Mithilesh Sinha (Chittaranjan Tripathy) from CWC was responsible for providing information to Vaishali.
Later that night, Vaishali discussed on her show the death of an officer from the Sitamarhi Social Welfare Department, and she believed that he was shot dead because he was putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department to look into the Munawwarpur shelter home case. With a white sheet in her hand, Vaishali claimed that she had every bit of information on how the Munawwarpur shelter home for girls operated. She stated that the next day, she would finally expose all the ministers and well-known personalities involved in the racket on her special program, Bhakshak.After the program was aired, the Chief Minister contacted Rajni Singh and instructed her to file an FIR immediately. Vaishali was hopeful that Jaspreet Gaur would be able to take the case forward from henceforth, but as it turned out, the FIR was filed in the woman's police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act. The Child Welfare Association would record the testimonies of the victim, and if they found anything worth investigating, action would be taken. Vaishali knew there was no hope because Bansi's close aide, Mithilesh Sinha, also a sexual predator, headed the Child Welfare Association. After speaking to the SSP, Vaishali realized that the only way to get the culprits behind bars was by gathering evidence.Vaishali decides to meet Sudha once again and convince her to come forward with her story. Sudha was not ready to endanger her life by becoming a witness in the case, but Vaishali helped her realize how she alone could save the lives of all the abused children. Sudha finally agreed to have her statement recorded. She stood before the camera with her face covered and narrated her entire experience.
Bansi and his associates realized it was the end of their free will. Bansi was an egoistic man, and he did not feel an ounce of shame for the heinous crime he committed. He did not allow Baby Rani and Sonu to throw away the bottles of alcohol and contraceptives stored at the shelter home. He was proud of himself, and he did not try to conceal the crime. Mithilesh walked away from Bansi, fearing losing his job. The next morning, police arrived at the Munawwarpur shelter home and rescued the girls. Bansi and his associates were arrested, and justice was finally served.Vaishali Singh addresses her audience, discussing how often the media fails to address issues of importance because of influence. At times, such cases are overlooked simply because they do not appeal to the audience as much as entertaining news does. She expresses her disappointment with the way the world functions, where there is a clear lack of emotion and sympathy, and people prefer to ignore rather than feel. Vaishali continues to play her part as a journalist, but she questions her audience, asking them if they are doing enough to be called human beings in the first place.</p>

Orphaned as a boy, raised in the Czech countryside by his doting grandparents, Jakub ProchÃ¡zka has risen from small-time scientist to become the country's first astronaut. When a dangerous solo mission to Jupiter offers him both the chance at heroism he's dreamt of and a way to atone for his father's sins as a Communist informer, he ventures boldly into the vast unknown. But in so doing, he leaves behind his devoted wife, Lenka, whose love, he realizes too late, he has sacrificed on the altar of his ambitions. Alone in Deep Space, Jakub discovers a possibly imaginary giant alien spider, who becomes his unlikely companion. Over philosophical conversations about the nature of love, life and death, and the deliciousness of hazelnut spread, the pair form an intense and emotional bond.â€”Bluewater</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

As she sneaks a moment to try dancing in the silks, she is surreptitiously discovered by Bennett (Oliver Renaud), a professional aerialist, who has returned home from performing around the world. Bennett is none too pleased to walk in to find his contractor messing around on the silks, but when his partner for an upcoming show drops out, he soon recruits Luna to perform with him. As the hard work of this dynamic sport and the joys of Luna returning to her roots as a dancer bring them closer together, will their relationship crash or will they find a way to reach new heights?</p>

                            <p>Description: Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra).
They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer.The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs.
After being "kidnapped", N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million).Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US.
Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation.
Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue.As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan.
Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew,
As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan.The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich.
The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield.
Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars.In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps.Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time.
The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute.Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina.Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany.
Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down.
Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa.Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus.Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control.
Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship.</p>

                            <p>Description: Ana (Camila Mendes) is an ambitious intern, dreaming of a career in the art world while trying to impress her demanding boss, Claire (Marisa Tomei) the head of Erwins New York. Ana hopes to earn Claire's recommendation to work at a top art gallery in New York. Claire is a sociopath perfectionist.
Because of the expensive cost of living in New York, Ana currently lives with her sister Vivian (Aimee Carrero) and Vivian's boyfriend Ronnie (Andrew Schulz), who has been urging her to move out.
Amy (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) is Ana's only friend at the office. During an auction at work, Ana realizes there has been a typo in the auction's catalog mislabeling the type of paint used on a piece that is about to be sold. Ana informs Claire of the error just in time to make the correction, gaining her a little respect. Claire fires Billy, the person who was in charge of the catalog.
The next morning Claire invites Ana to serve as the assistant to her assistants on an upcoming work trip to London. Claire asks Ana to pack her bags and to come straight to the airport.Upset by Ana's ambition, Claire's two assistants Suzette (Rachel Matthews) and Renee (Fola Evans-Akingbola) wait until the group is boarding their flight to reveal that they have booked Ana an economy ticket for a flight that leaves 4 hours later. The ticket agent at the check-in desk witnesses this mistreatment and decides to upgrade Ana's ticket to first class. While waiting for her flight in the first-class lounge Ana distractedly answers a phone call and proceeds to spill her Bloody Mary on a wealthy man named William (Archie Renaux). Ana and William end up sitting next to each other on the flight to London and hit it off. During the flight, Ana accidentally leads William to believe she is the art director of her company's New York office. He is very impressed and when they land, introduces Ana to his mother, Catherine (Lena Olin), who is a British celebrity. Catherine is introduced to Ana, and she offers to drop Ana at her hotel.
Catherine and Ana hit it off and she even takes Ana's number to stay in touch.Suzette and Renee continue to sabotage Ana, assigning her an office in the basement and a room at a separate cheaper hotel, while they stay at the Carlson, a swanky hotel 4 streets from William's home.
Arnold (Thomas Kretschmann) is the head of the company and is leading the sale of the prestigious Brovil collection, whose owner is known only to Arnold. Arnold has brought in Gerard (head of Paris office) and Claire to overlook the sale and ensure its success. Arnold is due to retire, which means both Gerard and Claire are up for the top job.
Ana receives a voicemail informing her that she left her laptop in Williams's car. That night she goes to Catherine's house to retrieve her laptop and finds herself in the middle of a party. There she sees Catherine's extensive art collection (which belonged to her husband, who passed away), meets a famous painter, and continues to lie about being the director of a New York auction house named Erwins.
Ana tells Catherine that her husband was a romantic, since his art collection tells a story of love. Catherine reveals that she recently asked Erwins to auction her collection. Her last name is Brovil. Catherine says that she is working with Claire and says that she will ask Arnold to work with Ana instead. Ana says that the sale is a secret, and she would get in trouble if Arnold found out that she was talking to Catherine.Suzette and Renee are tasked with getting last-minute tickets to a performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while continuing to assign Ana to all of the work they don't want to do. Desperate to get tickets to impress Claire, Ana asks Catherine who leaves tickets with William. Ana visits William who is coaching an at-risk youth soccer league. William invites her to have lunch with him which she has to decline due to her workload. William also tells her that there is a party being thrown that evening and his mother, Catherine, wants Ana to attend. Before Ana leaves, Will clarifies that he would also like her to attend, as his date.Ana runs back to the London office and arrives just as Claire asks Suzette if she got the tickets. Suzette is forced to admit that she was not able to and is further embarrassed when Ana shows her up and turns in the tickets to Claire. Background tensions rise as Gerard (Gregory Montel), the art director for the Paris office, and Claire are both vying for the company's head director position.Ana attends the party, with William and Catherine, in a designer dress that she "borrowed" from Claire (Claire had given the dress to Ana for dry-cleaning). Catherine admits to Ana that she is having second thoughts about selling her collection, due to the love of her husband that it represents.
When she suddenly sees Claire arrive with Suzette and Renee, she is scared her lie will be revealed and attempts to run off. Will catches her before she leaves and instead takes her to go dancing at a local bar. At the end of the night, William wants to take Ana back to her hotel. Embarrassed by where she is actually staying, Ana has William drop her off at Claire's much nicer hotel and makes an excuse to prevent him from coming inside. Before leaving, William confesses that he is falling in love with her.Over the next week, Ana and William continue to spend time together, growing closer and developing their relationship. William tells Ana that he has spent his whole life being used by other people but that she is different, and he admires her for being down-to-earth and humble despite her wealth and success. He tells her he knows her job is important and that he has arranged to transfer his work to New York so that they can continue their relationship.At the office, Claire praises Ana's hard work and promises that there will be a promotion in her future. Renee interrupts their meeting to reveal that a major client has just pulled out of their upcoming auction. That client is Catherine, William's mother. At that same moment, William arrives to surprise Ana at work, and she rushes him out of the building. William tells Ana that he had nothing to do with his mother's decision and doesn't understand why she is acting so strange. He questions whether Ana was just using him to secure his mother's sale and breaks up with her.When Ana goes back into the building, she is confronted by Claire who has discovered her lie and her relationship with William's family. She is fired and escorted out of the building.Ana visits Catherine and confesses that she is not the successful art director she was pretending to be. Instead of being upset, Catherine is proud of Ana for her honesty. She says that she was also using Ana by pretending to walk away from the auction to get a better deal from Erwins who had offered her 85 million pounds for her collection.
Catherine agrees to rejoin the auction on the condition that Ana is the one who handles the sale. Ana kicks Gerard off the auction and puts Claire in total control. Ana is re-hired and manages to sell Catherine's art for much more than expected (250 million pounds). She goes back to the soccer field and apologizes to William who tells her that he didn't like her because she was rich, he liked her because he thought she was an honest person.Ana returns to New York and six months later she has not heard from William but is thriving in her career. Ana throws a party to celebrate the opening of her own art gallery. At the end of the night, after everyone else has left, William arrives with a suitcase.</p>

                            <p>Description: Regency England. Of the two Dashwood sisters of marriageable age, Elinor, as the oldest, is the sensible, practical one, and Marianne is the die-hard romantic. In keeping to her word to her dying father Henry to keep the family together and seeing the writing on the wall that her half-brother John will not keep to his word in falling prey to the control wielded by his money-hungry wife Fanny, Elinor makes arrangements for herself, her two sisters, and their mother to move to humble Barton Cottage in Devonshire, from their Sussex country manor on Norland Park in knowing that John and Fanny will take over the manor despite having their own home in London, and that John will renege on his promise to Henry to ensure that his half-sisters and stepmother will be taken care of financially. In Devonshire, Marianne attracts the romantic attention of two men, the first, Colonel Brandon, who she sees as unromantic unlike herself. As such, she favors the second, John Willoughby, who she sees as having the same romantic sensibilities as her. Elinor, on the other hand, sees her first priority to her sisters and mother, and thus puts her feelings for Edward Ferrars, Fanny's stepbrother, on the back burner. Despite Edward stating that he wants happiness in his life over any ambition, career or financial, a union between the two of them seems unlikely regardless in Fanny implying that her mother, Edward's stepmother, would disinherit him in marrying someone beneath him like Elinor in the Dashwood women having no money. Secrets kept by Edward, Colonel Brandon, and Willoughby will affect not only Elinor and Marianne's marriage prospects, but also how they view the men in their lives.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Through rare interviews with victims' family members, eyewitnesses and experts on the criminal mind, this documentary reveals new insights into how Joran van der Sloot's lifelong pattern of violence and pathological lying leads to the deaths of two young women. Few killers have ever murdered again after they became famous for another killing, but on the fifth anniversary of Natalee Holloway's disappearance, Joran murders 21-year-old Stephany Flores in Peru. Hauntingly, his trip there is financed by money he extorted from Natalee Holloway's mother, Beth, after falsely promising to reveal where Natalee's body was for a price. In 2023--18 years after Natalee's disappearance--Beth Holloway finally gets her day in court with Joran, who admits for the first time that he murdered her daughter. His admission brings some long-sought comfort to Natalee's family, but Joran's history of deceit and manipulation leads some to question the details in his latest story.</p>

Orphaned as a boy, raised in the Czech countryside by his doting grandparents, Jakub ProchÃ¡zka has risen from small-time scientist to become the country's first astronaut. When a dangerous solo mission to Jupiter offers him both the chance at heroism he's dreamt of and a way to atone for his father's sins as a Communist informer, he ventures boldly into the vast unknown. But in so doing, he leaves behind his devoted wife, Lenka, whose love, he realizes too late, he has sacrificed on the altar of his ambitions. Alone in Deep Space, Jakub discovers a possibly imaginary giant alien spider, who becomes his unlikely companion. Over philosophical conversations about the nature of love, life and death, and the deliciousness of hazelnut spread, the pair form an intense and emotional bond.â€”Bluewater</p>

Twenty years after creating this "friend", Dean, JT, and Wes (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler) still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet the fabled Mr. Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator "Rock Hard" Rod (John Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role of a lifetime too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.</p>

Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location.
They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief.
Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken.
Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him.
Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.
In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague.
Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along.This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in.
Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves.
The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection.
This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house.
Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her.The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth.
Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief.
So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work.
However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up.
Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal.
Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art.
On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out.</p>

                            <p>Description: The film opens with a young Robert Nesta Marley (Nolan Collignon) joining his mother as they take a bus from one home to another. This is followed by text explaining how Bob Marley is still known today as Jamaica's biggest star. He grew up from humble beginnings around a time of violence in Jamaica during the 70s after the nation gained its independence from Great Britain.Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), already well into his career, goes to a press conference after announcing that he is planning to hold a peace concert, "Smile Jamaica", to unite the nation in the face of political discourse. Some critics fear that Bob is making it look like his is taking a side.Kingston, 1976 - Bob is playing soccer with his friends and sons when thugs start firing their guns in the streets. Bob protects his sons and takes them away, telling them not to worry about what happened (this is also where he starts to come up with "Three Little Birds"). They return to their home, where Bob talks to his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch), as the constant threat of violence around their family puts her on edge.Later, Bob goes to rehearse "I Shot The Sheriff" with his group, The Wailers. Rita steps out momentarily and sees two gunmen running towards the house, while a third aims his gun at her head. The two men enter the house and shoot at Bob and his friend Don Taylor (Anthony Welsh), while Rita has also been shot. Despite his injury, Bob rises to his feet and gets Don and Rita to the hospital. Bob sits by Rita's bedside as she lies unconscious. He reminisces about when they were teenagers (played by Quan-Dajai Henrique and Nia Ashi) and Bob began to court Rita.Following their recoveries, Bob still plans on going forward with the concert. Everyone close to him sees it as a bad idea for his safety and his family's, but he insists on doing it. On the night of the show, Bob goes and performs, but he briefly hallucinates seeing the gunman that shot him in the crowd. He then stops the show and reveals his injuries to the crowd before walking off the stage. Rita tries to comfort him, and Bob says he needs time to himself.Three months later, Bob travels to London with some of his friends. While there, they are arrested for possession of cannabis. In jail, Bob recalls how Rita first brought him into the Rastafari movement. He also thinks about witnessing his father abandon him and his mother when he was a child, and he refused to acknowledge Bob as his son.Later, Bob talks to his producer Chris Blackwell (James Norton) over ideas for a new album. Rita joins him in London while Bob and the Wailers are trying to come up with a new sound. Bob listens to the soundtrack to the film "Exodus" and starts to come up with his own song of the same name. With help from publicist Howard Bloom (Michael Gandolfini), the group makes their next album, "Exodus", which becomes a worldwide best-selling hit.Following the album's success, Bob goes on a tour throughout Europe in 1977. Although he sees much more success and popularity, Bob is seen engaging in an affair with a woman, Cindy Breakspeare (Umi Myers). During a pickup game of soccer, Bob is seen stumbling after an injury, but he brushes it off.Chris invites Bob and company to an event. While there, Bob gets jealous at seeing Rita talking to another man. When he goes outside to confront her, she in turn hits back at him with the knowledge of his own multiple affairs and the children he has produced as a result. Rita slaps Bob and also tells him to keep an eye out for Don, as he is doing some shady businesses behind Bob's back.After another show, Bob confronts Don backstage over what Rita told him. He begins to physically attack Don before his band mates and Rita pull Bob off of him.Not long after, Bob visits a doctor after Rita and Chris express concerns over a dark spot on Bob's toe where he injured himself during the pickup game. The doctor informs Bob that he has melanoma, and while it was recommended that he have the toe removed to stop the cancer from spreading, Bob declines and is left in a state of despair over the news. He talks to Rita, who gives him her own little speech and inspires him to return home to Jamaica.1978 - Bob makes his return to Jamaica, with a huge crowd gathering for him as the plane lands. Bob visits his old home, which is now empty. The same gunman that shot him enters the house, asking Bob for forgiveness. Bob says he holds no vengeance in his heart. Later, Bob sits with Rita and their sons around a campfire as he comes up with "Redemption Song". Rita says that Bob is ready to perform again.Bob and the Wailers later get ready as they gather for a large crowd in Jamaica for a new show. He then gets up to perform "One Love".Ending text states that Bob Marley passed away on May 11, 1981 from his cancer. However, footage is shown from his One Love Concert where he brought together leaders of opposing political parties as a symbol of unity.

                            <p>Description: Inspired by real stories, Friday Night Sext Scandal exposes the practice of young boys "hunting" nude photographs of female classmates in order to share and trade with others. When 16-year-old Shawn (Anthony Timpano), a talented football athlete, lands a spot in the starting lineup, he is welcomed into the team's inner circle. However, he soon discovers that these elite players are involved in a sick, secret game that is playing out under the noses of their community. Teenage boys are hunting for and posting nude photographs of their female classmates on a covert website where "bounties" on targeted girls are placed, and the compromising images are traded like baseball cards. Just as Shawn is riding the high of being on the team and with the girls at school, he suffers a serious knee injury that takes him out for the season. Feeling a loss of his new identity and wanting to maintain his status with his teammates, Shawn gives in to pressure and engages in his own secret "hunt," keeping his best friend Lauren (Keana Lyn Bastidas), and strong-willed mother, Lucinda (Tara Nicodemo), from knowing. But when the site and nude photographs of the teenage girls are discovered, Lucinda and others fight to hold those accountable, only to learn a devastating truth about those involved.</p>

                            <p>Description: In-between jobs, New York City fashion psychologist Lauren Elliott accepts short term work for her best friend Charlotte Gauthier's new boss, neurotic and high strung Virgil St-James, the successful head designer at Lavigne, a Paris fashion house, in the lead up to the debut of Virgil's latest collection at Paris Fashion Week. Her accepting the job is despite the comfort she finds only in her hometown of New York City, and not speaking French. Immediately at the end of Virgil's show, the murdered dead body of someone key at Lavigne is discovered backstage. The murder investigation is led by Inspector Andre Dubreuil of the municipal police. From initial evidence, he takes Charlotte into custody as the key suspect, who he can hold without charge up to forty-eight hours, which doesn't sit well with Lauren who will do anything to help her friend. Lauren doesn't understand Andre's haste in many people having seen to have had words or known to have had issue with the victim prior to the murder, Charlotte not among them. But Andre, in allowing Lauren access to the investigation, does recognize her invaluable assistance not only being a psychologist but being the daughter of a retired police detective, although the two do continue to butt heads in Andre's need to be by the books for reasons personal to him while Lauren will bend the rules whenever required in that aid to Charlotte. Lauren may not realize the danger she places herself in the closer she gets to discovering the identity of the murderer.â€”Huggo</p>

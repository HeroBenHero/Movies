                            <p>Description: Poor Boy centers on two families whose lives become mysteriously linked by events that occurred seven years earlier. "As they experience loss, longing, belief, love, and hope, their emotional journey forces them to face many truths, as secrets emerge, and lies are uncovered. By the time the story reaches its redemptive finale, the characters have a deeper understanding of who they are, and of the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships, as they, and the audience, are left to question their own sense of self."</p>

                            <p>Description: At a bar in Philadelphia in 1999, a man named Santos sits in a booth, nervously clutching a briefcase. He exits in a hurry and is followed by the bartender, who murders and decapitates him in an alley.Elsewhere in Philadelphia, Jamie and Sukie are lovers whose relationship falls apart due to Jamie's infidelity. After Sukie kicks Jamie out of their apartment, Jamie learns that her friend Marian is planning a trip to Tallahassee, Florida, and decides to tag along. They head into a drive-away car service, where someone can transport a car one-way for another client. Due to a misunderstanding, they are given a car that someone else has already booked for a trip to Tallahassee.Moments later, a trio of criminals-Arliss, Flint, and Chief-come to the shop to pick up the car headed to Tallahassee. They find that Jamie and Marian have taken it by accident, along with unspecified cargo that is part of their illegal dealings. While Marian wants to go straight to Tallahassee, Jamie constantly tries to convince Marian to loosen up by taking detours and trying to have casual sex at lesbian bars along the way. Marian prefers to read Henry James' The Europeans but slowly comes out of her shell due to Jamie's prodding. When the pair finally enter Florida, their car gets a flat tire. They open the trunk and find the briefcase Santos was holding and a basket containing Santos' head and a smoky white substance (likely dry ice or liquid nitrogen).Jamie and Marian are followed by Arliss and Flint, who are led on a wild goose chase by a soccer team who had invited Jamie and Marian to a party. When Jamie and Marian check into a hotel using Jamie's credit card, the mob is tipped off to their location. Jamie convinces Marian that she needs to have a positive sexual experience to enjoy life more, and they have sex. The next morning, Arliss, Flint, and the Chief arrive in Tallahassee, while Jamie decides to use the contents of Santos' briefcase: a collection of dildos that were created from plaster casts of men's erect penises. Marian is shocked, but Jamie insists that she just wants the sexual release that Marian had the night before.Immediately after Jamie climaxes, Arliss and Flint burst into their room, retrieve Santos' head and the briefcase, and abduct the women at gunpoint. In the backroom at a dog racing track, the Chief arrives to meet them all and explains that the sex toys are based on the genitals of powerful public figures, including one that was molded from Senator Channel's penis. Channel is fearful that his reputation will be ruined if anyone learns of the dildo, which Jamie had used earlier in the morning and subsequently left behind in the hotel room. After the gangsters have an argument that leads to Flint shooting the other two dead and running away, Jamie and Marian decide to blackmail Channel.Sukie has also been en route to Tallahassee in her capacity as a police officer after Jamie tipped her off. Jamie and Marian meet Channel at a lesbian bar and give him the dildo in exchange for one million dollars. Sukie intercepts them as they exit and Channel turns back around to try and kill the women. Sukie shoots Channel. Channel survives, but his reputation is ruined when newspapers begin publishing articles about his criminal connections and the dildo collection.The next day, Jamie and Marian meet with Marian's aunt at their hotel. Jamie casually mentions that she and Marian plan to go to Massachusetts, as same-sex marriage is legal there. As the trio drive away, a bellhop races to give them a bag that they have left behind, which contains two plaster casts Jamie had made of the dildo modeled after Channel's penis.</p>

                            <p>Description: Sister Mary sneaks into a superior's bedroom at night and steals a ring of keys to escape through the locked gates of the Roman Catholic convent. She is captured and knocked unconscious by four hooded figures. She later wakes up in a coffin and is buried alive.Sister Cecilia turned to Christianity at a young age after she nearly drowned in a frozen lake and was declared dead for seven minutes, convinced that God had saved her for a purpose. She receives an invitation from Father Sal Tedeschi to join a convent in Italy that tends to dying nuns in their last days. Cecilia takes vows to adhere to the evangelical counsels and becomes a nun, being decorated with a rosary.She befriends Sister Gwen and is struck by certain oddities, such as an elder nun having scars on her feet in the shape of crosses. The convent's chapel houses what they claim is a Holy Nail relic that was taken from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. Cecilia is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, even though she is a virgin and has never had relations with a man. The convent's inhabitants begin to treat her as the next Virgin Mary, with many proclaiming the child is a "blessing".Another nun, Sister Isabelle, tries to drown Cecilia out of jealousy, saying that it "should have been her." Cecilia throws up one of her own teeth and her health worsens. Her request to be taken to a proper hospital is denied by Father Tedeschi. Isabelle dies after falling off the convent's roof as Cecilia is walking through the cloister. Gwen publicly chastises the convent superiors for turning a blind eye but is then bundled away by Father Tedeschi and Deacon Enzo.At night, Cecilia notices that behind a painting of the Virgin Mary in her room, another nun had inscribed 2 Corinthians 11:14 on the wall, a hidden warning causing her to realize that something is wrong about this convent. Cecilia breaks open a drawer to read her file and is shocked to find information on the accident in her childhood. Hearing a woman screaming, she ventures further and is horrified to witness a hooded figure cutting out Gwen's tongue. An elder nun appears and silences Cecilia. She begs to escape but the elder chastises her, saying no one ever leaves the convent.She tries to escape the convent by faking a miscarriage using a dead chicken, but the deception is exposed. She attempts to run before being forcibly brought back by Tedeschi and Enzo. Tedeschi explains that he was a geneticist before becoming a priest and used DNA samples taken from the Holy Nail relic to impregnate nuns in the hopes of ushering in a new messiah. Until his success with Cecilia, Tedeschi's numerous attempts failed, often resulting in malformed fetuses. Tedeschi brands a cross into Cecilia's foot, a symbol also on many of the other nuns.Cecilia makes another attempt to escape. She beats Mother Superior to death using a crucifix, and shortly after, her water breaks. She manages to strangle the cardinal with her rosary before dousing Tedeschi's lab in ethanol. Tedeschi arrives and tries to stop her through physical force, but Cecilia narrowly escapes by igniting the ethanol with a lighter.Tedeschi manages to break out of the laboratory after extinguishing the flames and continues his pursuit against Cecilia, forcing her to flee into the catacombs under the convent. Cecilia finds Gwen's mutilated corpse along with a hole in the catacombs walls. Tedeschi finds her just as she is about to escape and a struggle ensues. Tedeschi tries to cut Cecilia's stomach open, but she stabs him in the throat with the Holy Nail relic, which she had previously stolen from the chapel. After exiting the catacombs, Cecilia agonizingly gives birth and bites through the umbilical cord herself. She is clearly horrified by the sight of the "baby", which is heard making gurgling and growling noises, while gasping for air. Cecilia stumbles away to grab and lift a nearby rock, which she uses to crush the experiment.</p>

                            <p>Description: Troubled former UFC middleweight fighter Elwood Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) makes a living scamming fighters on the underground circuit. He is approached by Frankie (Jessica Williams), the owner of an unruly roadhouse in the Florida Keys community of Glass Key, who offers him a job as head bouncer. Initially Frankie wanted to hire Carter (Austin Post), but had no option other than Dalton, when Dalton entered the ring and Carter refused to fight him because of his history and reputation.
Frankie says that her roadhouse was frequented by highway drivers, but lately it is attracting the wrong crowd. They come in every night, they trash the place, cops are of no help and all her bouncers left the job. Frankie offers Dalton $5000 per week for his services.
Initially hesitant, Dalton takes up the offer after narrowly averting a suicide attempt with a freight train that destroys his car. He takes a bus to Frankie's establishment, called simply The Road House, and befriends Charlie (Hannah Lanier), a teenager who runs a bookstore with her father, Stephen (Kevin Carroll).At the Road House, Dalton fends off a motorcycle gang led by Dell (JD Pardo) working for local crime boss Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen) and personally drives the injured thugs to the hospital, where he meets Ellie (Daniela Melchior), a doctor who tends to his injuries.
Staying in Frankie's disused houseboat, Dalton mentors the other bouncers like Billy (Lukas Gage) and becomes popular with the locals.
Ellie tries to warn Dalton that if he messes with the wrong group, the cops will not come to save him.
After an attempt on his life by Dell, Dalton finds him lying in wait at his houseboat. He throws Dell overboard but is unable to save him from being killed and eaten by a crocodile. Dalton wonders why the gang is interested in the Road House specifically.
Turns out Brandt was financing a real estate project and the Road House was in the way.Knox (Conor McGregor), a psychotic enforcer, is tasked by Brandt's incarcerated father to hunt down Dalton. After an unexpected date with Ellie, Dalton is confronted at gunpoint by Sheriff (Joaquim De Almeida), who tells him to leave town. However, Ellie, revealed to be the sheriff's daughter, intervenes. She explains that her father is in league with Ben Brandt, who has inherited his wealthy father Gerald's drug and real estate empire.
Brandt meets Dalton at the Road House and taunts him about his past: In a UFC title fight against a friend, Dalton was overcome with rage and killed his opponent in the ring. Knox arrives with Brandt's men, and an all-out bar fight ensues, leaving Dalton badly beaten.Frankie admits that Brandt has been buying up property to build an expensive resort, but she is the lone holdout. Frankie says that Brandt is out of cash and is borrowing money from shady guys. If she can hold out a little longer, Brandt will be killed
Dalton decides to leave town but discovers that Charlie and Stephen are in the hospital after Brandt's men burned down their bookstore. Enraged, Dalton kills one of the thugs responsible for burning down the bookstore. Dalton says that he is afraid of being enraged, as he knows that when he is angry, he will not be stopped by anyone. And now, he is angry and Brandt and Knox.
Dalton captures a sheriff's deputy making a large delivery of Brandt's illicit cash, framing the deputy for the murder and taking the money. The sheriff soon informs Dalton that Brandt has kidnapped Ellie and will exchange her for the money.Stealing a bomb-laden motorboat to reach Brandt's catamaran yacht, Dalton finds him with the sheriff, who tells him the kidnapping was a lie to lure Dalton aboard. However, Brandt double crosses the sheriff and reveals that he is holding Ellie hostage. Tempers flare as Knox approaches in his boat, but Dalton detonates the motorboat and finds Ellie below deck, attempting to smash a window. Fleeing the sinking yacht, Brandt recaptures Ellie while Dalton commandeers Knox's boat. Catching up to Brandt, Dalton and Ellie leap off as Brandt is launched on top of the Road House.Climbing up on a causeway, Knox carjacks a pickup truck and crashes into the Road House, leading to a brutal fistfight with Dalton. When Brandt orders him to kill Dalton, Knox snaps Brandt's neck instead. He prepares to finish off Dalton with a shard of wood, but Dalton gains the upper hand and repeatedly stabs Knox into submission, leaving him for dead. The sheriff arrives, agreeing to cover up for Dalton.As Frankie and Stephen begin to rebuild, Charlie says goodbye to Dalton as he waits for his bus out of town.

                            <p>Description: The film opens with a young Robert Nesta Marley (Nolan Collignon) joining his mother as they take a bus from one home to another. This is followed by text explaining how Bob Marley is still known today as Jamaica's biggest star. He grew up from humble beginnings around a time of violence in Jamaica during the 70s after the nation gained its independence from Great Britain.Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), already well into his career, goes to a press conference after announcing that he is planning to hold a peace concert, "Smile Jamaica", to unite the nation in the face of political discourse. Some critics fear that Bob is making it look like his is taking a side.Kingston, 1976 - Bob is playing soccer with his friends and sons when thugs start firing their guns in the streets. Bob protects his sons and takes them away, telling them not to worry about what happened (this is also where he starts to come up with "Three Little Birds"). They return to their home, where Bob talks to his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch), as the constant threat of violence around their family puts her on edge.Later, Bob goes to rehearse "I Shot The Sheriff" with his group, The Wailers. Rita steps out momentarily and sees two gunmen running towards the house, while a third aims his gun at her head. The two men enter the house and shoot at Bob and his friend Don Taylor (Anthony Welsh), while Rita has also been shot. Despite his injury, Bob rises to his feet and gets Don and Rita to the hospital. Bob sits by Rita's bedside as she lies unconscious. He reminisces about when they were teenagers (played by Quan-Dajai Henrique and Nia Ashi) and Bob began to court Rita.Following their recoveries, Bob still plans on going forward with the concert. Everyone close to him sees it as a bad idea for his safety and his family's, but he insists on doing it. On the night of the show, Bob goes and performs, but he briefly hallucinates seeing the gunman that shot him in the crowd. He then stops the show and reveals his injuries to the crowd before walking off the stage. Rita tries to comfort him, and Bob says he needs time to himself.Three months later, Bob travels to London with some of his friends. While there, they are arrested for possession of cannabis. In jail, Bob recalls how Rita first brought him into the Rastafari movement. He also thinks about witnessing his father abandon him and his mother when he was a child, and he refused to acknowledge Bob as his son.Later, Bob talks to his producer Chris Blackwell (James Norton) over ideas for a new album. Rita joins him in London while Bob and the Wailers are trying to come up with a new sound. Bob listens to the soundtrack to the film "Exodus" and starts to come up with his own song of the same name. With help from publicist Howard Bloom (Michael Gandolfini), the group makes their next album, "Exodus", which becomes a worldwide best-selling hit.Following the album's success, Bob goes on a tour throughout Europe in 1977. Although he sees much more success and popularity, Bob is seen engaging in an affair with a woman, Cindy Breakspeare (Umi Myers). During a pickup game of soccer, Bob is seen stumbling after an injury, but he brushes it off.Chris invites Bob and company to an event. While there, Bob gets jealous at seeing Rita talking to another man. When he goes outside to confront her, she in turn hits back at him with the knowledge of his own multiple affairs and the children he has produced as a result. Rita slaps Bob and also tells him to keep an eye out for Don, as he is doing some shady businesses behind Bob's back.After another show, Bob confronts Don backstage over what Rita told him. He begins to physically attack Don before his band mates and Rita pull Bob off of him.Not long after, Bob visits a doctor after Rita and Chris express concerns over a dark spot on Bob's toe where he injured himself during the pickup game. The doctor informs Bob that he has melanoma, and while it was recommended that he have the toe removed to stop the cancer from spreading, Bob declines and is left in a state of despair over the news. He talks to Rita, who gives him her own little speech and inspires him to return home to Jamaica.1978 - Bob makes his return to Jamaica, with a huge crowd gathering for him as the plane lands. Bob visits his old home, which is now empty. The same gunman that shot him enters the house, asking Bob for forgiveness. Bob says he holds no vengeance in his heart. Later, Bob sits with Rita and their sons around a campfire as he comes up with "Redemption Song". Rita says that Bob is ready to perform again.Bob and the Wailers later get ready as they gather for a large crowd in Jamaica for a new show. He then gets up to perform "One Love".Ending text states that Bob Marley passed away on May 11, 1981 from his cancer. However, footage is shown from his One Love Concert where he brought together leaders of opposing political parties as a symbol of unity. It is also stated that Time Magazine called "Exodus" one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

                            <p>Description: Troubled former UFC middleweight fighter Elwood Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) makes a living scamming fighters on the underground circuit. He is approached by Frankie (Jessica Williams), the owner of an unruly roadhouse in the Florida Keys community of Glass Key, who offers him a job as head bouncer. Initially Frankie wanted to hire Carter (Austin Post), but had no option other than Dalton, when Dalton entered the ring and Carter refused to fight him because of his history and reputation.
Frankie says that her roadhouse was frequented by highway drivers, but lately it is attracting the wrong crowd. They come in every night, they trash the place, cops are of no help and all her bouncers left the job. Frankie offers Dalton $5000 per week for his services.
Initially hesitant, Dalton takes up the offer after narrowly averting a suicide attempt with a freight train that destroys his car. He takes a bus to Frankie's establishment, called simply The Road House, and befriends Charlie (Hannah Lanier), a teenager who runs a bookstore with her father, Stephen (Kevin Carroll).At the Road House, Dalton fends off a motorcycle gang led by Dell (JD Pardo) working for local crime boss Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen) and personally drives the injured thugs to the hospital, where he meets Ellie (Daniela Melchior), a doctor who tends to his injuries.
Staying in Frankie's disused houseboat, Dalton mentors the other bouncers like Billy (Lukas Gage) and becomes popular with the locals.
Ellie tries to warn Dalton that if he messes with the wrong group, the cops will not come to save him.
After an attempt on his life by Dell, Dalton finds him lying in wait at his houseboat. He throws Dell overboard but is unable to save him from being killed and eaten by a crocodile. Dalton wonders why the gang is interested in the Road House specifically.
Turns out Brandt was financing a real estate project and the Road House was in the way.Knox (Conor McGregor), a psychotic enforcer, is tasked by Brandt's incarcerated father to hunt down Dalton. After an unexpected date with Ellie, Dalton is confronted at gunpoint by Sheriff (Joaquim De Almeida), who tells him to leave town. However, Ellie, revealed to be the sheriff's daughter, intervenes. She explains that her father is in league with Ben Brandt, who has inherited his wealthy father Gerald's drug and real estate empire.
Brandt meets Dalton at the Road House and taunts him about his past: In a UFC title fight against a friend, Dalton was overcome with rage and killed his opponent in the ring. Knox arrives with Brandt's men, and an all-out bar fight ensues, leaving Dalton badly beaten.Frankie admits that Brandt has been buying up property to build an expensive resort, but she is the lone holdout. Frankie says that Brandt is out of cash and is borrowing money from shady guys. If she can hold out a little longer, Brandt will be killed
Dalton decides to leave town but discovers that Charlie and Stephen are in the hospital after Brandt's men burned down their bookstore. Enraged, Dalton kills one of the thugs responsible for burning down the bookstore. Dalton says that he is afraid of being enraged, as he knows that when he is angry, he will not be stopped by anyone. And now, he is angry and Brandt and Knox.
Dalton captures a sheriff's deputy making a large delivery of Brandt's illicit cash, framing the deputy for the murder and taking the money. The sheriff soon informs Dalton that Brandt has kidnapped Ellie and will exchange her for the money.Stealing a bomb-laden motorboat to reach Brandt's catamaran yacht, Dalton finds him with the sheriff, who tells him the kidnapping was a lie to lure Dalton aboard. However, Brandt double crosses the sheriff and reveals that he is holding Ellie hostage. Tempers flare as Knox approaches in his boat, but Dalton detonates the motorboat and finds Ellie below deck, attempting to smash a window. Fleeing the sinking yacht, Brandt recaptures Ellie while Dalton commandeers Knox's boat. Catching up to Brandt, Dalton and Ellie leap off as Brandt is launched on top of the Road House.Climbing up on a causeway, Knox carjacks a pickup truck and crashes into the Road House, leading to a brutal fistfight with Dalton. When Brandt orders him to kill Dalton, Knox snaps Brandt's neck instead. He prepares to finish off Dalton with a shard of wood, but Dalton gains the upper hand and repeatedly stabs Knox into submission, leaving him for dead. The sheriff arrives, agreeing to cover up for Dalton.As Frankie and Stephen begin to rebuild, Charlie says goodbye to Dalton as he waits for his bus out of town. Stephen discovers Dalton has left them the trunk of cash as the bus pulls away. In a mid-credits scene, Knox has survived and assaults the hospital staff, leaving in his gown.</p>

                            <p>Description: Sister Mary sneaks into a superior's bedroom at night and steals a ring of keys to escape through the locked gates of the Roman Catholic convent. She is captured and knocked unconscious by four hooded figures. She later wakes up in a coffin and is buried alive.Sister Cecilia turned to Christianity at a young age after she nearly drowned in a frozen lake and was declared dead for seven minutes, convinced that God had saved her for a purpose. She receives an invitation from Father Sal Tedeschi to join a convent in Italy that tends to dying nuns in their last days. Cecilia takes vows to adhere to the evangelical counsels and becomes a nun, being decorated with a rosary.She befriends Sister Gwen and is struck by certain oddities, such as an elder nun having scars on her feet in the shape of crosses. The convent's chapel houses what they claim is a Holy Nail relic that was taken from the cross on which Jesus was crucified. Cecilia is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, even though she is a virgin and has never had relations with a man. The convent's inhabitants begin to treat her as the next Virgin Mary, with many proclaiming the child is a "blessing".Another nun, Sister Isabelle, tries to drown Cecilia out of jealousy, saying that it "should have been her." Cecilia throws up one of her own teeth and her health worsens. Her request to be taken to a proper hospital is denied by Father Tedeschi. Isabelle dies after falling off the convent's roof as Cecilia is walking through the cloister. Gwen publicly chastises the convent superiors for turning a blind eye but is then bundled away by Father Tedeschi and Deacon Enzo.At night, Cecilia notices that behind a painting of the Virgin Mary in her room, another nun had inscribed 2 Corinthians 11:14 on the wall, a hidden warning causing her to realize that something is wrong about this convent. Cecilia breaks open a drawer to read her file and is shocked to find information on the accident in her childhood. Hearing a woman screaming, she ventures further and is horrified to witness a hooded figure cutting out Gwen's tongue. An elder nun appears and silences Cecilia. She begs to escape but the elder chastises her, saying no one ever leaves the convent.She tries to escape the convent by faking a miscarriage using a dead chicken, but the deception is exposed. She attempts to run before being forcibly brought back by Tedeschi and Enzo. Tedeschi explains that he was a geneticist before becoming a priest and used DNA samples taken from the Holy Nail relic to impregnate nuns in the hopes of ushering in a new messiah. Until his success with Cecilia, Tedeschi's numerous attempts failed, often resulting in malformed fetuses. Tedeschi brands a cross into Cecilia's foot, a symbol also on many of the other nuns.Cecilia makes another attempt to escape. She beats Mother Superior to death using a crucifix, and shortly after, her water breaks. She manages to strangle the cardinal with her rosary before dousing Tedeschi's lab in ethanol. Tedeschi arrives and tries to stop her through physical force, but Cecilia narrowly escapes by igniting the ethanol with a lighter.Tedeschi manages to break out of the laboratory after extinguishing the flames and continues his pursuit against Cecilia, forcing her to flee into the catacombs under the convent. Cecilia finds Gwen's mutilated corpse along with a hole in the catacombs walls. Tedeschi finds her just as she is about to escape and a struggle ensues. Tedeschi tries to cut Cecilia's stomach open, but she stabs him in the throat with the Holy Nail relic, which she had previously stolen from the chapel. After exiting the catacombs, Cecilia agonizingly gives birth and bites through the umbilical cord herself. She is clearly horrified by the sight of the "baby", which is heard making gurgling and growling noises, while gasping for air. Cecilia stumbles away to grab and lift a nearby rock, which she uses to crush the experiment.</p>

                            <p>Description: At a bar in Philadelphia in 1999, a man named Santos sits in a booth, nervously clutching a briefcase. He exits in a hurry and is followed by the bartender, who murders and decapitates him in an alley.Elsewhere in Philadelphia, Jamie and Sukie are lovers whose relationship falls apart due to Jamie's infidelity. After Sukie kicks Jamie out of their apartment, Jamie learns that her friend Marian is planning a trip to Tallahassee, Florida, and decides to tag along. They head into a drive-away car service, where someone can transport a car one-way for another client. Due to a misunderstanding, they are given a car that someone else has already booked for a trip to Tallahassee.Moments later, a trio of criminals-Arliss, Flint, and Chief-come to the shop to pick up the car headed to Tallahassee. They find that Jamie and Marian have taken it by accident, along with unspecified cargo that is part of their illegal dealings. While Marian wants to go straight to Tallahassee, Jamie constantly tries to convince Marian to loosen up by taking detours and trying to have casual sex at lesbian bars along the way. Marian prefers to read Henry James' The Europeans but slowly comes out of her shell due to Jamie's prodding. When the pair finally enter Florida, their car gets a flat tire. They open the trunk and find the briefcase Santos was holding and a basket containing Santos' head and a smoky white substance (likely dry ice or liquid nitrogen).Jamie and Marian are followed by Arliss and Flint, who are led on a wild goose chase by a soccer team who had invited Jamie and Marian to a party. When Jamie and Marian check into a hotel using Jamie's credit card, the mob is tipped off to their location. Jamie convinces Marian that she needs to have a positive sexual experience to enjoy life more, and they have sex. The next morning, Arliss, Flint, and the Chief arrive in Tallahassee, while Jamie decides to use the contents of Santos' briefcase: a collection of dildos that were created from plaster casts of men's erect penises. Marian is shocked, but Jamie insists that she just wants the sexual release that Marian had the night before.Immediately after Jamie climaxes, Arliss and Flint burst into their room, retrieve Santos' head and the briefcase, and abduct the women at gunpoint. In the backroom at a dog racing track, the Chief arrives to meet them all and explains that the sex toys are based on the genitals of powerful public figures, including one that was molded from Senator Channel's penis. Channel is fearful that his reputation will be ruined if anyone learns of the dildo, which Jamie had used earlier in the morning and subsequently left behind in the hotel room. After the gangsters have an argument that leads to Flint shooting the other two dead and running away, Jamie and Marian decide to blackmail Channel.Sukie has also been en route to Tallahassee in her capacity as a police officer after Jamie tipped her off. Jamie and Marian meet Channel at a lesbian bar and give him the dildo in exchange for one million dollars. Sukie intercepts them as they exit and Channel turns back around to try and kill the women. Sukie shoots Channel. Channel survives, but his reputation is ruined when newspapers begin publishing articles about his criminal connections and the dildo collection.The next day, Jamie and Marian meet with Marian's aunt at their hotel. Jamie casually mentions that she and Marian plan to go to Massachusetts, as same-sex marriage is legal there. As the trio drive away, a bellhop races to give them a bag that they have left behind, which contains two plaster casts Jamie had made of the dildo modeled after Channel's penis.</p>

                            <p>Description: Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the eldest daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may still be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must replace her by drinking the Water of Life: a poison fatal for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sand-worm, and taking part in raids against Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names "Usul" and "Muad'Dib". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to secure his genetic lineage.Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays North fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads him to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks the northern Fremen-including Sietch Tabr-forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south; Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Paul now has a clearer vision of the past, present, and future. He sees an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and learns that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures.The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar to a death duel for leadership. He refuses, instead galvanizing the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch an offensive using atomics and sand-worms to overpower the Sardaukar forces. Paul murders the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands Irulan's hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement in the destruction of House Atreides. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring, thus surrendering.After the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war.Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sand-worm.</p>

                            <p>Description: Children's book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Alice enjoys Jessica but Taylor keeps her at arms length. Jessica is plagued by nightmares which include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear in the basement named Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor named Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, reunites with her. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember.Alice and Taylor's mentally disturbed biological mother Samantha sneaks into the house to see her daughters and attacks Jessica. When the police arrive to arrest Samantha, Taylor confesses to texting her. Jessica then puts Alice and Chauncey to bed, and remarks that she had a similar childhood friend.Max leaves to embark on tour and Alice becomes hyper-focused on a scavenger hunt she claims was given to her by Chauncey. Chauncey's overwhelming presence in Alice's life begins to disturb Jessica. One day when Jessica leaves to visit Ben, Taylor invites an acquaintance over, Liam. Liam grabs a bottle of liquor which he accidentally shatters. He attempts to find a towel before being toyed with by Chauncey, who briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica arrives back home, angering Taylor.Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail prompting her to call a child psychologist named Dr. Soto. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey while also speaking on his behalf. Chauncey makes threatening remarks towards Jessica and Alice sobs over their crumbling friendship. Jessica later discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto then shows Jessica footage of a past patient who uses the same phrase as Alice: "Never Ever". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey which Taylor blames her stepmother for.Taylor meets Gloria, who tells her that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains to Taylor that imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned, which Jessica did with Chauncey. At home, Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and of the Never Ever. All three women complete the scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm to appear.In the Never Ever realm, the group find a door showing Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, Jessica was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but he became mad in the process after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Afterwards, Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm throughout her life. Gloria is savagely mauled by Chauncey when a door opens beside her. Jessica and Taylor rush off, searching for Alice. Both find Alice and attempt to escape while Chauncey pursues behind them. Jessica is able to stop Chauncey by stabbing him in the eye with scissors.After reuniting with Ben and Max at Ben's institution, Jessica realizes she is still stuck in the Never Ever. Chauncey used Alice as bait to get to Jessica and seeks revenge for her prior abandonment. Taylor arrives and saves Jessica. Chauncey turns to his true form akin to Simon. The spider tries to turn Jessica and Taylor insane with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire and seals him behind the door. The family escapes as the house burns to the ground.The family check into a hotel but are frightened by a child playing with his teddy bear who resembles Chauncey. The three leave to another hotel for their safety.</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers. In the process, the two start to fall for each other. What happens between them is affected by the fate of the book in the club which may inadvertently impact the store.â€”Huggo</p>

After Earth is left uninhabitable due to lack of oxygen, a mother Maya (Hudson), and her daughter Zora (Wallis) are forced to live underground, with trips to the surface only made possible by a coveted state-of-the-art oxygen suit made by Maya's husband, Darius, whom she presumes to be dead. When a mysterious couple arrives that claims to know Darius and his fate, Maya agrees to let them into their bunker but these visitors are not who they claim to be resulting in a mother and daughter fighting for their survival.â€”olisilumea</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers. In the process, the two start to fall for each other. What happens between them is affected by the fate of the book in the club which may inadvertently impact the store.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Children's book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Alice enjoys Jessica but Taylor keeps her at arms length. Jessica is plagued by nightmares which include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear in the basement named Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor named Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, reunites with her. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember.Alice and Taylor's mentally disturbed biological mother Samantha sneaks into the house to see her daughters and attacks Jessica. When the police arrive to arrest Samantha, Taylor confesses to texting her. Jessica then puts Alice and Chauncey to bed, and remarks that she had a similar childhood friend.Max leaves to embark on tour and Alice becomes hyper-focused on a scavenger hunt she claims was given to her by Chauncey. Chauncey's overwhelming presence in Alice's life begins to disturb Jessica. One day when Jessica leaves to visit Ben, Taylor invites an acquaintance over, Liam. Liam grabs a bottle of liquor which he accidentally shatters. He attempts to find a towel before being toyed with by Chauncey, who briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica arrives back home, angering Taylor.Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail prompting her to call a child psychologist named Dr. Soto. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey while also speaking on his behalf. Chauncey makes threatening remarks towards Jessica and Alice sobs over their crumbling friendship. Jessica later discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto then shows Jessica footage of a past patient who uses the same phrase as Alice: "Never Ever". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey which Taylor blames her stepmother for.Taylor meets Gloria, who tells her that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains to Taylor that imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned, which Jessica did with Chauncey. At home, Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and of the Never Ever. All three women complete the scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm to appear.In the Never Ever realm, the group find a door showing Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, Jessica was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but he became mad in the process after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Afterwards, Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm throughout her life. Gloria is savagely mauled by Chauncey when a door opens beside her. Jessica and Taylor rush off, searching for Alice. Both find Alice and attempt to escape while Chauncey pursues behind them. Jessica is able to stop Chauncey by stabbing him in the eye with scissors.After reuniting with Ben and Max at Ben's institution, Jessica realizes she is still stuck in the Never Ever. Chauncey used Alice as bait to get to Jessica and seeks revenge for her prior abandonment. Taylor arrives and saves Jessica. Chauncey turns to his true form akin to Simon. The spider tries to turn Jessica and Taylor insane with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire and seals him behind the door. The family escapes as the house burns to the ground.The family check into a hotel but are frightened by a child playing with his teddy bear who resembles Chauncey. The three leave to another hotel for their safety.</p>

                            <p>Description: Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the eldest daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may still be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must replace her by drinking the Water of Life: a poison fatal for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sand-worm, and taking part in raids against Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names "Usul" and "Muad'Dib". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to secure his genetic lineage.Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays North fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads him to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks the northern Fremen-including Sietch Tabr-forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south; Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Paul now has a clearer vision of the past, present, and future. He sees an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and learns that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures.The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar to a death duel for leadership. He refuses, instead galvanizing the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch an offensive using atomics and sand-worms to overpower the Sardaukar forces. Paul murders the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands Irulan's hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement in the destruction of House Atreides. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring, thus surrendering.After the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war.Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sand-worm.</p>

                            <p>Description: Peter Barrett (Charlie Weber), a CIA covert operative, is approached at a diner by a man in disguise. The man is revealed to be Peter's CIA superior and adopted father, Henry Byrne (Jon Voight). Byrne had adopted Peter after Peter's parents, who were close with Byrne, were killed in a terrorist attack and Peter temporarily lost his hearing. Peter's hearing returned, though now ultra sensitive, giving him ultrasonic hearing.The mission is track at Russian arms dealer/drug smuggler, download the contents of his watch, and then eliminate them. After Byrne leaves, Peter calls his pregnant wife, Elena Maran (Rryla McIntosh), who is also a CIA agent.The mission starts well with Peter easily capturing the target (Doug Chapman), downloading the contents, and wiping out the target's bodyguards. Once the download is complete, which the target had to be alive for, Peter goes to kill the target but is stopped by Elena and two other agents. The target has been the subject of a year long investigation and Elena's team need him to stand trial. Peter hesitates on what to do and the target grabs a gun firing at Peter. Peter is grazed by the bullet but shoots and kills the target. Elena, however, is hit directly in the stomach.Elena survives but loses the baby and eventually leaves Peter. Peter relationship with Byrne also falls apart as Peter blames Byrne for ordering the mission knowing Elena could show up, though Byrne denies knowing that her team was involved.Seventeen years later Elena is still working for the CIA, while Peter is now living a life of solitude as a painter in the mountains in Cascade, Oregon. Elena receives incriminating evidence about the CIA from her colleague, Dennis (Stephen Lobo), shortly before he is killed by an assassin looking for the evidence.Peter, now going by the alias Mark Nicholson, receives a package addressed to Peter Barrett. The packages contain two art books with an inscription from Elena, something she used to do when they were married as he'd always drip paint on the books.He later visits a bar run by his friend Lucy (Leah Gibson). While there Peter is approached by a teenage girl, Sophia (Madison Bailey), who addresses him as Peter. Sophia is Elena's daughter and says her mom told her to find Peter Barrett if anything ever happens to her. Elena is now missing and Sophia found Peter hoping he'd help find her. Peter denies that he is Peter or that he knows Sophia's mother.Sophie follows Peter home and eventually gets him to admit his identity after discovering a painting of her mom. She confronts Peter and claims she is his daughter too, but the house is then attacked by mercenaries with Sophia killing the final attacker. Peter and Sophia flee the house with Peter grabbing a few belongings, including the art books that Elena had sent.Naomi Piasecki (Marie Avgeropoulos), Section Chief for the CIA, watches body cam footage of Peter's attack. She calls in Agent Kim (Luisa d'Oliviera) and orders a manhunt to be put on for Peter, who she accuses of going rogue and murdering eight federal agents who were there to investigate him for possession of classified information.Piasecki and Kim deliver the news to Byrne, now a high ranking CIA official. He is furious that agents when it like they did and accuses the CIA using Piasecki to cover-up old messes. Piasecki tells Kim to put a tail and track on Byrne, believing he is hiding something.Peter and Sophia find Niles (Jason Gray-Stanford), the owner of a computer hardware/software store, and asks him to hack into the CIA network and determine why he was attacked. Niles at first refuses knowing how to, but after Peter shows him his gun Niles agrees to help. He finds that Peter's record is now classified and Elena is claimed to have went dark on a mission.Peter calls Byrne who tells Peter that two agents came to his house asking about him. Peter agrees to meet with Byrne in secret, believing Byrne is the best chance to find Elena. Agent Kim is able to trace Niles' hacking to Cascade, Oregon and sends a team to retrieve him.Sophia once again confronts Peter about him lying and though he feels guilt about lying, he still denies being her father. Meanwhile, eccentric CIA assassin Ghost (Max Montesi), who had previously killed Elena's colleague Dennis, arrives in Cascade and goes through Peter's apartment tracking him to Lucy's bar.Peter meets with Byrne demanding to know why the CIA tried to kill him. Byrne says he doesn't know but has pieced together that Piasecki believes Peter is in possession of something that greatly threatens national security. When asked about Sophia's identity, Byrne also rejects the possibility that Peter and Elena are the parents.Ghost attacks Lucy at the bar and demands to know where Peter went, though she denies knowing Peter. Peter takes Byrne to meet Sophia and he begins aggressively questioning her at gun point. However, Sophia easily answers all of Byrne's questions and he agrees to call in a check on Elena's status, which reveals that Elena was killed in service. Sophia maintains that Elena had to have sent her to Peter for a reason, but Peter once again confirms he hasn't had any contact with Elena for years. He promises Sophia that he is going to find out what happened to Elena and take care of whoever did it.Peter examines the art books that she sent and finds a small flash drive inside the spine. He leaves Sophia with Byrne and heads out. Piasecki and Kim arrive in Cascade and Kim reveals that Byrne is nowhere to be found.Peter takes the flash drive to Niles, who Byrne confirmed Peter's suspicion of being a CIA operative sent to keep an eye on Peter, for decryption. The files all pertain to a CIA black-ops program called The Internship. Peter hears Ghost approaching and he takes cover with Niles. Ghost uses a high pitched whistle to incapacitate to Peter, but he still escapes the store with the flash drive. Ghost questions Niles for information, though it is clear that Ghost knows about The Internship, and then kills him.Peter goes to Lucy's bar and finds her beaten to death. He reviews the files and finds a video from Elena. Elena explains that the The Internship was a program run by the CIA that stole young children to train them to become the perfect assassins. Dennis, Elena's colleague, was attempting to remove an asset from the program when he was killed. Elena also confirms that Sophia is their daughter, telling Peter that she doesn't know how but she's alive. The video breaks out after Elena tells Peter he must protect her and that Sophia is in danger.Peter races back to Byrne and Sophia but finds that Piasecki's CIA operatives have already arrived. He is attacked and kills two guards before Sophia is dragged into the back of a van and driven away as Peter and Byrne fire at the car. Byrne tells Peter to go follow the van and he'll be able to hide himself.Byrne is intercepted by more operatives and Piasecki orders them to eliminate Peter over the objections of Agent Kim. The agents open fire on his truck blowing it up, but not before Peter is able to escape.Peter, who is barely conscious from his wounds, is found that night by Junk Man, a French homeless man who is often found around Cascade. Agent Kim reveals to Piasecki that they have found no evidence of Peter and Piasecki orders them to end the search. The Junk Man is revealed to be Byrne in disguise, who has taken to Peter to a secret bunker for recovery.Piasecki and Kim interrogate Sophia who reveals that she is Elena and Peter's daughter, accusing Piasecki of killing her mother. Piasecki denies that the CIA wants to kill Peter or had anything to do with Elena and then threaten her for more information. She orders everyone, including Agent Kim, out of the room.Peter and Byrne review the files show that Piasecki is running The Internship program, which temporarily dulls certain senses to hope they recover like Peter's did, creating the ultimate assassin team. However, before they can continue looking through the files it receives a virus and self-destructs.Peter remembers that Elena sent two books and likely put a second copy in the other book. Byrne wants to go get it but Peter refuses, owing it to Elena to find Sophia first. He uses a tracker he had given her earlier to locate her, taking some weapons from the stockpile that Byrne had.Agent Kim criticizes Piasecki for breaking protocol with the interrogation and threatens to report her. Piasecki claims she'll report herself after the threat is neutralized and reveals a tracker she found Sophia, something Kim missed in her previous search. Piasecki warns that Peter is coming and to prepare for an attack.Agent Kim orders the agents to various defensive positions but Peter easily infiltrates the facility killing multiple agents. Peter reaches the control room and fights off the agents. Kim leaves Piasecki to help get Sophia to safety. Piasecki intercepts them bringing them to a different part of the facility. She orders Agent Kim to leave them but when Kim refuses, she is shot and killed by Piasecki.Peter is attacked by Ghost who reveals himself to be an alum of the Internship. Ghost wants to be the one who kills Peter, who. he refers to as "Patient Zero." Peter tries to break through to Ghost and get him to escape from the CIA but Ghost mocks him and attacks again. Ghost nearly beats Peter but after revealing that he killed Elena, he infuriates Peter who grabs a wood shard and stabs Ghost through the eye killing him.Peter finds Piasecki and the two fire at each other with Piasecki revealed to have heightened senses as well. She explains that she was an Intern who know leads the program. Sophia arrives with two CIA guards. She orders Peter to put his weapon down and hand over the flash drive.However, Byrne arrives killing the two guards and forcing Piasecki to put her gun down. Peter turns his gun on Byrne accusing him of starting The Internship and being Piasecki's superior, which Byrne admits to. Byrne apologizes for involving Peter, saying they only wanted to find the information. Peter claims Byrne is only trying to save his legacy but he claims Sophia is his new legacy and hands her a gun which she points at Peter. Sophia orders Peter to give over the flash drive but when he refuses she shoots him in the arm. Byrne claims she is the new perfect weapon, kidnapping her after she was born and "pronounced dead." Peter tries to get through to Sophia, telling her that Byrne kidnapped her and after Elena was sent the files and discovered the truth, she confronted Byrne and he had her killed by Ghost. He begs her to decide for herself and not be controlled by Byrne. He tells her how much he loved her mother and her mother loved her while Byrne orders her to kill Peter. She turns the gun killing Byrne and wounding Piasecki.Sophia still expresses admiration for Byrne, but telling Peter he was thinking too small. She warns Peter she is coming for the flash drive and likely won't remember he is her father but she and Peter have a small farewell.Peter returns home and finds the other copy. He opens the files and finds the video that cut off earlier. Elena confirms his theories about Byrne and tells him he must help all of The Interns. He smiles as he hears a sniper zoning in and sees Sophia with it.</p>

In fact, they need it. Looking to shake things up, they decide to ROLE PLAY. The rules are simple - they meet as strangers for one night to rekindle their relationship. While waiting for her 'stranger' at a hotel bar in New York, Emma attracts the attention of a mysterious older man (Bill Nighy), who stays to buy her and Dave drinks long into the night. 24 hours later, the man is found dead and a murder investigation is launched. Emma and Dave's role play game now becomes a case of mistaken identity that leads to Emma disappearing and Dave being questioned by the police for murder. As disguises unravel, Dave uncovers the unbelievable truth: his wife Emma is a professional assassin who has been living a double life for years.â€”STUDIOCANAL</p>

                            <p>Description: An intergalactic odyssey of love, ambition, and self-discovery. Orphaned as a boy, raised in the Czech countryside by his doting grandparents, Jakub ProchÃ¡zka has risen from small-time scientist to become the country's first astronaut. When a dangerous solo mission to Jupiter offers him both the chance at heroism he's dreamt of and a way to atone for his father's sins as a Communist informer, he ventures boldly into the vast unknown. But in so doing, he leaves behind his devoted wife, Lenka, whose love, he realizes too late, he has sacrificed on the altar of his ambitions. Alone in Deep Space, Jakub discovers a possibly imaginary giant alien spider, who becomes his unlikely companion. Over philosophical conversations about the nature of love, life and death, and the deliciousness of hazelnut spread, the pair form an intense and emotional bond.â€”Bluewater</p>

                            <p>Description: Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra).
They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer.The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs.
After being "kidnapped", N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million).Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US.
Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation.
Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue.As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan.
Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew,
As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan.The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich.
The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield.
Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars.In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps.Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time.
The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute.Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina.Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany.
Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down.
Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa.Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus.Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control.
Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship.</p>

                            <p>Description: Peter Barrett (Charlie Weber), a CIA covert operative, is approached at a diner by a man in disguise. The man is revealed to be Peter's CIA superior and adopted father, Henry Byrne (Jon Voight). Byrne had adopted Peter after Peter's parents, who were close with Byrne, were killed in a terrorist attack and Peter temporarily lost his hearing. Peter's hearing returned, though now ultra sensitive, giving him ultrasonic hearing.The mission is track at Russian arms dealer/drug smuggler, download the contents of his watch, and then eliminate them. After Byrne leaves, Peter calls his pregnant wife, Elena Maran (Rryla McIntosh), who is also a CIA agent.The mission starts well with Peter easily capturing the target (Doug Chapman), downloading the contents, and wiping out the target's bodyguards. Once the download is complete, which the target had to be alive for, Peter goes to kill the target but is stopped by Elena and two other agents. The target has been the subject of a year long investigation and Elena's team need him to stand trial. Peter hesitates on what to do and the target grabs a gun firing at Peter. Peter is grazed by the bullet but shoots and kills the target. Elena, however, is hit directly in the stomach.Elena survives but loses the baby and eventually leaves Peter. Peter relationship with Byrne also falls apart as Peter blames Byrne for ordering the mission knowing Elena could show up, though Byrne denies knowing that her team was involved.Seventeen years later Elena is still working for the CIA, while Peter is now living a life of solitude as a painter in the mountains in Cascade, Oregon. Elena receives incriminating evidence about the CIA from her colleague, Dennis (Stephen Lobo), shortly before he is killed by an assassin looking for the evidence.Peter, now going by the alias Mark Nicholson, receives a package addressed to Peter Barrett. The packages contain two art books with an inscription from Elena, something she used to do when they were married as he'd always drip paint on the books.He later visits a bar run by his friend Lucy (Leah Gibson). While there Peter is approached by a teenage girl, Sophia (Madison Bailey), who addresses him as Peter. Sophia is Elena's daughter and says her mom told her to find Peter Barrett if anything ever happens to her. Elena is now missing and Sophia found Peter hoping he'd help find her. Peter denies that he is Peter or that he knows Sophia's mother.Sophie follows Peter home and eventually gets him to admit his identity after discovering a painting of her mom. She confronts Peter and claims she is his daughter too, but the house is then attacked by mercenaries with Sophia killing the final attacker. Peter and Sophia flee the house with Peter grabbing a few belongings, including the art books that Elena had sent.Naomi Piasecki (Marie Avgeropoulos), Section Chief for the CIA, watches body cam footage of Peter's attack. She calls in Agent Kim (Luisa d'Oliviera) and orders a manhunt to be put on for Peter, who she accuses of going rogue and murdering eight federal agents who were there to investigate him for possession of classified information.Piasecki and Kim deliver the news to Byrne, now a high ranking CIA official. He is furious that agents when it like they did and accuses the CIA using Piasecki to cover-up old messes. Piasecki tells Kim to put a tail and track on Byrne, believing he is hiding something.Peter and Sophia find Niles (Jason Gray-Stanford), the owner of a computer hardware/software store, and asks him to hack into the CIA network and determine why he was attacked. Niles at first refuses knowing how to, but after Peter shows him his gun Niles agrees to help. He finds that Peter's record is now classified and Elena is claimed to have went dark on a mission.Peter calls Byrne who tells Peter that two agents came to his house asking about him. Peter agrees to meet with Byrne in secret, believing Byrne is the best chance to find Elena. Agent Kim is able to trace Niles' hacking to Cascade, Oregon and sends a team to retrieve him.Sophia once again confronts Peter about him lying and though he feels guilt about lying, he still denies being her father. Meanwhile, eccentric CIA assassin Ghost (Max Montesi), who had previously killed Elena's colleague Dennis, arrives in Cascade and goes through Peter's apartment tracking him to Lucy's bar.Peter meets with Byrne demanding to know why the CIA tried to kill him. Byrne says he doesn't know but has pieced together that Piasecki believes Peter is in possession of something that greatly threatens national security. When asked about Sophia's identity, Byrne also rejects the possibility that Peter and Elena are the parents.Ghost attacks Lucy at the bar and demands to know where Peter went, though she denies knowing Peter. Peter takes Byrne to meet Sophia and he begins aggressively questioning her at gun point. However, Sophia easily answers all of Byrne's questions and he agrees to call in a check on Elena's status, which reveals that Elena was killed in service. Sophia maintains that Elena had to have sent her to Peter for a reason, but Peter once again confirms he hasn't had any contact with Elena for years. He promises Sophia that he is going to find out what happened to Elena and take care of whoever did it.Peter examines the art books that she sent and finds a small flash drive inside the spine. He leaves Sophia with Byrne and heads out. Piasecki and Kim arrive in Cascade and Kim reveals that Byrne is nowhere to be found.Peter takes the flash drive to Niles, who Byrne confirmed Peter's suspicion of being a CIA operative sent to keep an eye on Peter, for decryption. The files all pertain to a CIA black-ops program called The Internship. Peter hears Ghost approaching and he takes cover with Niles. Ghost uses a high pitched whistle to incapacitate to Peter, but he still escapes the store with the flash drive. Ghost questions Niles for information, though it is clear that Ghost knows about The Internship, and then kills him.Peter goes to Lucy's bar and finds her beaten to death. He reviews the files and finds a video from Elena. Elena explains that the The Internship was a program run by the CIA that stole young children to train them to become the perfect assassins. Dennis, Elena's colleague, was attempting to remove an asset from the program when he was killed. Elena also confirms that Sophia is their daughter, telling Peter that she doesn't know how but she's alive. The video breaks out after Elena tells Peter he must protect her and that Sophia is in danger.Peter races back to Byrne and Sophia but finds that Piasecki's CIA operatives have already arrived. He is attacked and kills two guards before Sophia is dragged into the back of a van and driven away as Peter and Byrne fire at the car. Byrne tells Peter to go follow the van and he'll be able to hide himself.Byrne is intercepted by more operatives and Piasecki orders them to eliminate Peter over the objections of Agent Kim. The agents open fire on his truck blowing it up, but not before Peter is able to escape.Peter, who is barely conscious from his wounds, is found that night by Junk Man, a French homeless man who is often found around Cascade. Agent Kim reveals to Piasecki that they have found no evidence of Peter and Piasecki orders them to end the search. The Junk Man is revealed to be Byrne in disguise, who has taken to Peter to a secret bunker for recovery.Piasecki and Kim interrogate Sophia who reveals that she is Elena and Peter's daughter, accusing Piasecki of killing her mother. Piasecki denies that the CIA wants to kill Peter or had anything to do with Elena and then threaten her for more information. She orders everyone, including Agent Kim, out of the room.Peter and Byrne review the files show that Piasecki is running The Internship program, which temporarily dulls certain senses to hope they recover like Peter's did, creating the ultimate assassin team. However, before they can continue looking through the files it receives a virus and self-destructs.Peter remembers that Elena sent two books and likely put a second copy in the other book. Byrne wants to go get it but Peter refuses, owing it to Elena to find Sophia first. He uses a tracker he had given her earlier to locate her, taking some weapons from the stockpile that Byrne had.Agent Kim criticizes Piasecki for breaking protocol with the interrogation and threatens to report her. Piasecki claims she'll report herself after the threat is neutralized and reveals a tracker she found Sophia, something Kim missed in her previous search. Piasecki warns that Peter is coming and to prepare for an attack.Agent Kim orders the agents to various defensive positions but Peter easily infiltrates the facility killing multiple agents. Peter reaches the control room and fights off the agents. Kim leaves Piasecki to help get Sophia to safety. Piasecki intercepts them bringing them to a different part of the facility. She orders Agent Kim to leave them but when Kim refuses, she is shot and killed by Piasecki.Peter is attacked by Ghost who reveals himself to be an alum of the Internship. Ghost wants to be the one who kills Peter, who. he refers to as "Patient Zero." Peter tries to break through to Ghost and get him to escape from the CIA but Ghost mocks him and attacks again. Ghost nearly beats Peter but after revealing that he killed Elena, he infuriates Peter who grabs a wood shard and stabs Ghost through the eye killing him.Peter finds Piasecki and the two fire at each other with Piasecki revealed to have heightened senses as well. She explains that she was an Intern who know leads the program. Sophia arrives with two CIA guards. She orders Peter to put his weapon down and hand over the flash drive.However, Byrne arrives killing the two guards and forcing Piasecki to put her gun down. Peter turns his gun on Byrne accusing him of starting The Internship and being Piasecki's superior, which Byrne admits to. Byrne apologizes for involving Peter, saying they only wanted to find the information. Peter claims Byrne is only trying to save his legacy but he claims Sophia is his new legacy and hands her a gun which she points at Peter. Sophia orders Peter to give over the flash drive but when he refuses she shoots him in the arm. Byrne claims she is the new perfect weapon, kidnapping her after she was born and "pronounced dead." Peter tries to get through to Sophia, telling her that Byrne kidnapped her and after Elena was sent the files and discovered the truth, she confronted Byrne and he had her killed by Ghost. He begs her to decide for herself and not be controlled by Byrne. He tells her how much he loved her mother and her mother loved her while Byrne orders her to kill Peter. She turns the gun killing Byrne and wounding Piasecki.Sophia still expresses admiration for Byrne, but telling Peter he was thinking too small. She warns Peter she is coming for the flash drive and likely won't remember he is her father but she and Peter have a small farewell.Peter returns home and finds the other copy. He opens the files and finds the video that cut off earlier. Elena confirms his theories about Byrne and tells him he must help all of The Interns. He smiles as he hears a sniper zoning in and sees Sophia with it.</p>

                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

Orphaned as a boy, raised in the Czech countryside by his doting grandparents, Jakub ProchÃ¡zka has risen from small-time scientist to become the country's first astronaut. When a dangerous solo mission to Jupiter offers him both the chance at heroism he's dreamt of and a way to atone for his father's sins as a Communist informer, he ventures boldly into the vast unknown. But in so doing, he leaves behind his devoted wife, Lenka, whose love, he realizes too late, he has sacrificed on the altar of his ambitions. Alone in Deep Space, Jakub discovers a possibly imaginary giant alien spider, who becomes his unlikely companion. Over philosophical conversations about the nature of love, life and death, and the deliciousness of hazelnut spread, the pair form an intense and emotional bond.â€”Bluewater</p>

                            <p>Description: Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra).
They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer.The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs.
After being "kidnapped", N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million).Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US.
Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation.
Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue.As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan.
Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew,
As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan.The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich.
The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield.
Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars.In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps.Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time.
The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute.Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina.Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany.
Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down.
Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa.Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus.Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control.
Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship.</p>

                            <p>Description: Director and Activist Joey Carbstrong goes undercover with fellow activists to infiltrate and expose the deeply ingrained corruption and heartbreaking abuse that lies at the heart of the UK's 'pork industry.' "Pignorant" follows former gang member turned animal activist, Joey, as he embarks on a three-year-long undercover investigation. Joey takes us on an eye-opening journey to witness first hand what life is really like for farmed pigs in the UK - a country that claims to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. The story centres around a dangerous mission to expose a long running, hidden aspect of the world wide pork industry - CO2 gas chambers.</p>

                            <p>Description: When three childhood best friends pull a prank that goes wrong, they invent the imaginary Ricky Stanicky to get them out of trouble. Twenty years after creating this "friend", Dean, JT, and Wes (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler) still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet the fabled Mr. Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator "Rock Hard" Rod (John Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role of a lifetime too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alexandre Daigle was a fairytale solution to all of the Ottawa Senators' many problems. Just a teenager, Alex was a charismatic French-speaking Canadian, a one-man dream come true for a team and a city that desperately needed goals and fans. The expectations were overwhelming and soon, Daigle fell short of what the team and the fans had fantasized about. Now, decades later, Daigle reflects on life - both on and off the ice.</p>

                            <p>Description: Through rare interviews with victims' family members, eyewitnesses and experts on the criminal mind, this documentary reveals new insights into how Joran van der Sloot's lifelong pattern of violence and pathological lying leads to the deaths of two young women. Few killers have ever murdered again after they became famous for another killing, but on the fifth anniversary of Natalee Holloway's disappearance, Joran murders 21-year-old Stephany Flores in Peru. Hauntingly, his trip there is financed by money he extorted from Natalee Holloway's mother, Beth, after falsely promising to reveal where Natalee's body was for a price. In 2023--18 years after Natalee's disappearance--Beth Holloway finally gets her day in court with Joran, who admits for the first time that he murdered her daughter. His admission brings some long-sought comfort to Natalee's family, but Joran's history of deceit and manipulation leads some to question the details in his latest story.</p>

                            <p>Description: Orion seems a lot like your average elementary school kid shy, unassuming, harboring a secret crush. But underneath his seemingly normal exterior, Orion is a ball of adolescent anxiety, completely consumed by irrational fears of bees, dogs, the ocean, cell phone waves, murderous gutter clowns, and even falling off of a cliff. But of all his fears, the thing he's the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grows closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic, MEAN GIRLS. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called "The Plastics," ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (ReneÃ© Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina's crosshairs.

                            <p>Description: In 1989, Lisa Swallows is a lonely teenage girl still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her mother, who was killed by an axe murderer two years earlier. Lisa's father, Dale, remarries a horrid and narcissistic woman named Janet. From the remarriage, Lisa gains a popular, cheerful stepsister, Taffy. Lisa spends much of her time in the local Bachelor's Grove Cemetery, much to the chagrin of her family.After an unfortunate tanning bed electrocution, Lisa heads to a party with Taffy. She is then accidentally drugged and nearly sexually assaulted by a classmate, Doug. Lisa, disoriented and upset, returns to the cemetery and speaks to the grave of a young Victorian man who died in 1837, expressing her desire to be with him. The young man had been a musician who had fallen in love with a woman in his own time, before she had left him for another man. He was shortly killed after being struck by lightning, leaving him to be buried in the bachelor's cemetery. A bolt of green lightning strikes the grave after Lisa leaves, and the young man (referred to as "the Creature" in the film's credits) is brought back to life as a lovesick zombie.Janet berates Lisa for breaking a mirror prior. While Lisa is home alone, the Creature breaks into the house. Despite initially being terrified, Lisa realizes he is the young man whose grave she dotes on, and decides to hide the Creature in her bedroom closet. The Creature is mute, missing multiple body parts, and covered in dirt and debris, all attributes he is deeply ashamed of.After the break-in, Lisa claims that a burglar broke in to explain the mess made by the Creature, but Janet claims she is making it up for attention and to upset Dale, insisting that Lisa is either "crazy" or "inconsiderate". After The Creature leaves a worm in Janet's food, she chastises Lisa and threatens to send her to an asylum. The Creature kills Janet, cutting off her left ear, which Lisa sews onto his head. Prior, both dump Janet's body into the cemetery. Lisa figures out that, using electrocution, body parts can become one with him. She then uses Taffy's tanning bed to put in his ear. Lisa later lures Doug to the cemetery so that the Creature can cut off Doug's right hand. Doug, terrified, tries to run away, but the Creature kills him and hides his body with Janet's. With these new attachments, the Creature starts looking more like his old self, and he and Lisa start to bond further.The police start to investigate Janet's and Doug's disappearances. Taffy sulks over her disappearance while Lisa is unfazed. Lisa narrowly avoids being implicated before going to the home of her crush, Michael, resolving to lose her virginity to him. She finds him in bed with Taffy, despite the latter being aware of Lisa's interest in him, and is devastated. The Creature then enters, chopping off Michael's penis, causing him to bleed to death. He prepares to attack Taffy, but Lisa intervenes. He then drives to the cemetery, and Lisa, with a traumatized Taffy in tow, follows him. Before Lisa goes after the Creature to kill him, she gives Taffy her late mother's rosary as a token for her kindness and sympathy.Lisa confronts the Creature, who admits he loves her. They leave the cemetery after throwing a police officer into an open grave. Lisa attaches Michael's penis to the Creature so they can have sex. With the police zeroing in on Lisa, and now fully embracing death, she convinces the Creature to electrocute her in the tanning bed. The Creature turns on the tanning bed's highest setting, causing Lisa to burn to death.Some time later, Dale and Taffy visit Lisa and Janet's graves. The Creature, now fully alive and able to speak, sits on a park bench and reads Percy Shelley's To Mary to a resurrected and bandaged Lisa as she lies on his lap.</p>

                            <p>Description: From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic, MEAN GIRLS. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called "The Plastics," ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (ReneÃ© Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina's crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group's apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.â€”Paramount Pictures</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.â€”Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Orion seems a lot like your average elementary school kid shy, unassuming, harboring a secret crush. But underneath his seemingly normal exterior, Orion is a ball of adolescent anxiety, completely consumed by irrational fears of bees, dogs, the ocean, cell phone waves, murderous gutter clowns, and even falling off of a cliff. But of all his fears, the thing he's the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grows closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.</p>

                            <p>Description: Through rare interviews with victims' family members, eyewitnesses and experts on the criminal mind, this documentary reveals new insights into how Joran van der Sloot's lifelong pattern of violence and pathological lying leads to the deaths of two young women. Few killers have ever murdered again after they became famous for another killing, but on the fifth anniversary of Natalee Holloway's disappearance, Joran murders 21-year-old Stephany Flores in Peru. Hauntingly, his trip there is financed by money he extorted from Natalee Holloway's mother, Beth, after falsely promising to reveal where Natalee's body was for a price. In 2023--18 years after Natalee's disappearance--Beth Holloway finally gets her day in court with Joran, who admits for the first time that he murdered her daughter. His admission brings some long-sought comfort to Natalee's family, but Joran's history of deceit and manipulation leads some to question the details in his latest story.</p>

                            <p>Description: When three childhood best friends pull a prank that goes wrong, they invent the imaginary Ricky Stanicky to get them out of trouble. Twenty years after creating this "friend", Dean, JT, and Wes (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler) still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet the fabled Mr. Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator "Rock Hard" Rod (John Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role of a lifetime too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.</p>

"Pignorant" follows former gang member turned animal activist, Joey, as he embarks on a three-year-long undercover investigation. Joey takes us on an eye-opening journey to witness first hand what life is really like for farmed pigs in the UK - a country that claims to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. The story centres around a dangerous mission to expose a long running, hidden aspect of the world wide pork industry - CO2 gas chambers.</p>

                            <p>Description: Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra).
They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer.The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs.
After being "kidnapped", N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million).Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US.
Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation.
Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue.As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan.
Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew,
As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan.The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich.
The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield.
Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars.In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps.Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time.
The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute.Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina.Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany.
Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down.
Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa.Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus.Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control.
Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship.</p>

                            <p>Description: An intergalactic odyssey of love, ambition, and self-discovery. Orphaned as a boy, raised in the Czech countryside by his doting grandparents, Jakub ProchÃ¡zka has risen from small-time scientist to become the country's first astronaut. When a dangerous solo mission to Jupiter offers him both the chance at heroism he's dreamt of and a way to atone for his father's sins as a Communist informer, he ventures boldly into the vast unknown. But in so doing, he leaves behind his devoted wife, Lenka, whose love, he realizes too late, he has sacrificed on the altar of his ambitions. Alone in Deep Space, Jakub discovers a possibly imaginary giant alien spider, who becomes his unlikely companion. Over philosophical conversations about the nature of love, life and death, and the deliciousness of hazelnut spread, the pair form an intense and emotional bond.â€”Bluewater</p>

                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

                            <p>Description: Peter Barrett (Charlie Weber), a CIA covert operative, is approached at a diner by a man in disguise. The man is revealed to be Peter's CIA superior and adopted father, Henry Byrne (Jon Voight). Byrne had adopted Peter after Peter's parents, who were close with Byrne, were killed in a terrorist attack and Peter temporarily lost his hearing. Peter's hearing returned, though now ultra sensitive, giving him ultrasonic hearing.The mission is track at Russian arms dealer/drug smuggler, download the contents of his watch, and then eliminate them. After Byrne leaves, Peter calls his pregnant wife, Elena Maran (Rryla McIntosh), who is also a CIA agent.The mission starts well with Peter easily capturing the target (Doug Chapman), downloading the contents, and wiping out the target's bodyguards. Once the download is complete, which the target had to be alive for, Peter goes to kill the target but is stopped by Elena and two other agents. The target has been the subject of a year long investigation and Elena's team need him to stand trial. Peter hesitates on what to do and the target grabs a gun firing at Peter. Peter is grazed by the bullet but shoots and kills the target. Elena, however, is hit directly in the stomach.Elena survives but loses the baby and eventually leaves Peter. Peter relationship with Byrne also falls apart as Peter blames Byrne for ordering the mission knowing Elena could show up, though Byrne denies knowing that her team was involved.Seventeen years later Elena is still working for the CIA, while Peter is now living a life of solitude as a painter in the mountains in Cascade, Oregon. Elena receives incriminating evidence about the CIA from her colleague, Dennis (Stephen Lobo), shortly before he is killed by an assassin looking for the evidence.Peter, now going by the alias Mark Nicholson, receives a package addressed to Peter Barrett. The packages contain two art books with an inscription from Elena, something she used to do when they were married as he'd always drip paint on the books.He later visits a bar run by his friend Lucy (Leah Gibson). While there Peter is approached by a teenage girl, Sophia (Madison Bailey), who addresses him as Peter. Sophia is Elena's daughter and says her mom told her to find Peter Barrett if anything ever happens to her. Elena is now missing and Sophia found Peter hoping he'd help find her. Peter denies that he is Peter or that he knows Sophia's mother.Sophie follows Peter home and eventually gets him to admit his identity after discovering a painting of her mom. She confronts Peter and claims she is his daughter too, but the house is then attacked by mercenaries with Sophia killing the final attacker. Peter and Sophia flee the house with Peter grabbing a few belongings, including the art books that Elena had sent.Naomi Piasecki (Marie Avgeropoulos), Section Chief for the CIA, watches body cam footage of Peter's attack. She calls in Agent Kim (Luisa d'Oliviera) and orders a manhunt to be put on for Peter, who she accuses of going rogue and murdering eight federal agents who were there to investigate him for possession of classified information.Piasecki and Kim deliver the news to Byrne, now a high ranking CIA official. He is furious that agents when it like they did and accuses the CIA using Piasecki to cover-up old messes. Piasecki tells Kim to put a tail and track on Byrne, believing he is hiding something.Peter and Sophia find Niles (Jason Gray-Stanford), the owner of a computer hardware/software store, and asks him to hack into the CIA network and determine why he was attacked. Niles at first refuses knowing how to, but after Peter shows him his gun Niles agrees to help. He finds that Peter's record is now classified and Elena is claimed to have went dark on a mission.Peter calls Byrne who tells Peter that two agents came to his house asking about him. Peter agrees to meet with Byrne in secret, believing Byrne is the best chance to find Elena. Agent Kim is able to trace Niles' hacking to Cascade, Oregon and sends a team to retrieve him.Sophia once again confronts Peter about him lying and though he feels guilt about lying, he still denies being her father. Meanwhile, eccentric CIA assassin Ghost (Max Montesi), who had previously killed Elena's colleague Dennis, arrives in Cascade and goes through Peter's apartment tracking him to Lucy's bar.Peter meets with Byrne demanding to know why the CIA tried to kill him. Byrne says he doesn't know but has pieced together that Piasecki believes Peter is in possession of something that greatly threatens national security. When asked about Sophia's identity, Byrne also rejects the possibility that Peter and Elena are the parents.Ghost attacks Lucy at the bar and demands to know where Peter went, though she denies knowing Peter. Peter takes Byrne to meet Sophia and he begins aggressively questioning her at gun point. However, Sophia easily answers all of Byrne's questions and he agrees to call in a check on Elena's status, which reveals that Elena was killed in service. Sophia maintains that Elena had to have sent her to Peter for a reason, but Peter once again confirms he hasn't had any contact with Elena for years. He promises Sophia that he is going to find out what happened to Elena and take care of whoever did it.Peter examines the art books that she sent and finds a small flash drive inside the spine. He leaves Sophia with Byrne and heads out. Piasecki and Kim arrive in Cascade and Kim reveals that Byrne is nowhere to be found.Peter takes the flash drive to Niles, who Byrne confirmed Peter's suspicion of being a CIA operative sent to keep an eye on Peter, for decryption. The files all pertain to a CIA black-ops program called The Internship. Peter hears Ghost approaching and he takes cover with Niles. Ghost uses a high pitched whistle to incapacitate to Peter, but he still escapes the store with the flash drive. Ghost questions Niles for information, though it is clear that Ghost knows about The Internship, and then kills him.Peter goes to Lucy's bar and finds her beaten to death. He reviews the files and finds a video from Elena. Elena explains that the The Internship was a program run by the CIA that stole young children to train them to become the perfect assassins. Dennis, Elena's colleague, was attempting to remove an asset from the program when he was killed. Elena also confirms that Sophia is their daughter, telling Peter that she doesn't know how but she's alive. The video breaks out after Elena tells Peter he must protect her and that Sophia is in danger.Peter races back to Byrne and Sophia but finds that Piasecki's CIA operatives have already arrived. He is attacked and kills two guards before Sophia is dragged into the back of a van and driven away as Peter and Byrne fire at the car. Byrne tells Peter to go follow the van and he'll be able to hide himself.Byrne is intercepted by more operatives and Piasecki orders them to eliminate Peter over the objections of Agent Kim. The agents open fire on his truck blowing it up, but not before Peter is able to escape.Peter, who is barely conscious from his wounds, is found that night by Junk Man, a French homeless man who is often found around Cascade. Agent Kim reveals to Piasecki that they have found no evidence of Peter and Piasecki orders them to end the search. The Junk Man is revealed to be Byrne in disguise, who has taken to Peter to a secret bunker for recovery.Piasecki and Kim interrogate Sophia who reveals that she is Elena and Peter's daughter, accusing Piasecki of killing her mother. Piasecki denies that the CIA wants to kill Peter or had anything to do with Elena and then threaten her for more information. She orders everyone, including Agent Kim, out of the room.Peter and Byrne review the files show that Piasecki is running The Internship program, which temporarily dulls certain senses to hope they recover like Peter's did, creating the ultimate assassin team. However, before they can continue looking through the files it receives a virus and self-destructs.Peter remembers that Elena sent two books and likely put a second copy in the other book. Byrne wants to go get it but Peter refuses, owing it to Elena to find Sophia first. He uses a tracker he had given her earlier to locate her, taking some weapons from the stockpile that Byrne had.Agent Kim criticizes Piasecki for breaking protocol with the interrogation and threatens to report her. Piasecki claims she'll report herself after the threat is neutralized and reveals a tracker she found Sophia, something Kim missed in her previous search. Piasecki warns that Peter is coming and to prepare for an attack.Agent Kim orders the agents to various defensive positions but Peter easily infiltrates the facility killing multiple agents. Peter reaches the control room and fights off the agents. Kim leaves Piasecki to help get Sophia to safety. Piasecki intercepts them bringing them to a different part of the facility. She orders Agent Kim to leave them but when Kim refuses, she is shot and killed by Piasecki.Peter is attacked by Ghost who reveals himself to be an alum of the Internship. Ghost wants to be the one who kills Peter, who. he refers to as "Patient Zero." Peter tries to break through to Ghost and get him to escape from the CIA but Ghost mocks him and attacks again. Ghost nearly beats Peter but after revealing that he killed Elena, he infuriates Peter who grabs a wood shard and stabs Ghost through the eye killing him.Peter finds Piasecki and the two fire at each other with Piasecki revealed to have heightened senses as well. She explains that she was an Intern who know leads the program. Sophia arrives with two CIA guards. She orders Peter to put his weapon down and hand over the flash drive.However, Byrne arrives killing the two guards and forcing Piasecki to put her gun down. Peter turns his gun on Byrne accusing him of starting The Internship and being Piasecki's superior, which Byrne admits to. Byrne apologizes for involving Peter, saying they only wanted to find the information. Peter claims Byrne is only trying to save his legacy but he claims Sophia is his new legacy and hands her a gun which she points at Peter. Sophia orders Peter to give over the flash drive but when he refuses she shoots him in the arm. Byrne claims she is the new perfect weapon, kidnapping her after she was born and "pronounced dead." Peter tries to get through to Sophia, telling her that Byrne kidnapped her and after Elena was sent the files and discovered the truth, she confronted Byrne and he had her killed by Ghost. He begs her to decide for herself and not be controlled by Byrne. He tells her how much he loved her mother and her mother loved her while Byrne orders her to kill Peter. She turns the gun killing Byrne and wounding Piasecki.Sophia still expresses admiration for Byrne, but telling Peter he was thinking too small. She warns Peter she is coming for the flash drive and likely won't remember he is her father but she and Peter have a small farewell.Peter returns home and finds the other copy. He opens the files and finds the video that cut off earlier. Elena confirms his theories about Byrne and tells him he must help all of The Interns. He smiles as he hears a sniper zoning in and sees Sophia with it.</p>

                            <p>Description: The film opens in Greece, where suave British spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill) prepares to move in on his target, a terrorist named LaGrange (Dua Lipa). After a brief dance together, LaGrange has her assassins draw their guns on Argylle. He then contacts his partner Keira (Ariana DeBose), who uses her tech to find a way for Argylle to get out. LaGrange then corners Argylle and Keira outside and fires at them, hitting Keira in the chest. As Argylle tries to save her, he contacts his other associate, Wyatt (John Cena), to catch LaGrange before she can escape. Wyatt catches her, and he and Argylle interrogate LaGrange to learn who her employer is. It turns out she is working for Fowler (Richard E. Grant), the director who also employed Argylle and Wyatt. LaGrange poisons herself before she can be brought in, and Argylle now wonders who he can really trust.The scene shifts to a book reading by Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), author of the "Argylle" book series that the character originates from, as the entire scene was from the last chapter of the fourth book in the series. After answering some questions, she later goes to her private cabin with her pet cat Alfie so that she can begin to write the fifth book. She spends the evening writing the whole thing, thinking she has completed it before going to bed.In the morning, Elly is contacted by her mother Ruth (Catherine O'Hara), who spent all night reading the manuscript Elly sent her. Ruth says the book is good, but she doesn't like the ending, calling it a "copout". Elly then starts trying to write another new chapter to try and give the book better closure. She envisions several scenarios to give Argylle a better ending, but she finds herself drawing a blank.Elly decides to take a train with Alfie to visit Ruth in Chicago when she suggests to help Elly finish the book. On the train, she is approached by a man named Aiden Wilde (Sam Rockwell). He pretends to be a fan of Elly's before informing her there are people on the train who are targeting her. Moments later, a "fan" comes by with a knife disguised as a pen, forcing Aiden to jump into action and start fighting assassins while Elly tries to hide, though she visualizes Argylle himself in Aiden's place. One of the assassins is a man named Carlos (Tomas Paredes), whom Elly recognizes from the book reading as a supposed fan. Aiden then takes Elly to the end of the train where he blasts the doors off and parachutes with her (and Alfie) out of the train, where she passes out midair.When Elly wakes up, Aiden has cut his hair and reveals he took her to a cabin. He informs her that the assassins come from a sinister organization called The Division, led by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston). They believe that Elly's books predict certain events in their line of work, and they have already read her manuscript for Book Five and are waiting on her to write the final chapter. Ritter is shown executing his Deputy Director (Rob Delaney) for failing to apprehend Elly and reacquiring a Master File that can expose all agents of The Division.

Hoping to get an idea of where to find Bakunin, Aiden convinces Elly to start writing the next chapter, which Ritter and his men listen in on because some fans record Elly on their phones.The duo are led to an apartment supposedly belonging to Bakunin. They find nothing but an opening under the floorboards, where Aiden finds a book with information</p>

Franklin's family is always on the move with his dad's military job, and everywhere he goes Franklin finds support in a notebook filled with his grandfather's advice on friendship. But when Franklin tries his usual strategies with the Peanuts gang, he has trouble fitting in. That's until he learns about the neighborhood Soap Box Derby race - according to his grandfather, everyone loves a winner. He's sure that winning the race will also mean winning over some new friends. All he needs is a partner, which he finds in Charlie Brown.

But as the race nears, the pressure mounts - can their car and their newfound friendship make it to the finish line?â€”Apple TV+</p>

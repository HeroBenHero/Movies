                            <p>Description: On July 11, 2021, Wembley Stadium was on the brink of a historic win for Gareth Southgate's England team. The squad had inspired the country on their journey to England's first major final since 1966, and the European Championship was within their reach. But as England supporters arrived at Wembley from all corners of the country, celebration quickly turned to chaos. Mayhem took over with scenes of drunkenness and drug-taking, and ticketless fans saw an opportunity to storm the stadium. With compelling first-hand testimony and visceral user-generated content, this is the dramatic story of a day that began with euphoria, and ended in a nation left reeling.</p>

                            <p>Description: For generations, bumblebees have roamed the earth, tirelessly pollinating our crops and wildflowers, and contributing to the biodiversity of our ecosystems. But with the changing climate and other threats, the survival of these beloved pollinators has been put in jeopardy. "Franklin's Bumblebee," a once-common species, is now critically endangered, with the last sighting dating back to 2006. Today, a group of scientists and explorers embark on a week-long mission every July to search for this elusive bumblebee, hoping to find it before it's too late. This documentary follows the journey of over 50 dedicated individuals as they search for Franklin's Bumblebee and discuss the four major threats to bumblebee populations worldwide: access to food, habitat loss, pesticide use, and disease. Through stunning cinematography and insightful interviews, we explore the vital role of bumblebees in our ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these important pollinators. Join us on this journey to uncover the fate of Franklin's Bumblebee and learn how we can help protect bumblebees and preserve the natural world we all share.—Janice Overbeck</p>

                            <p>Description: Children's book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Alice enjoys Jessica but Taylor keeps her at arms length. Jessica is plagued by nightmares which include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear in the basement named Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor named Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, reunites with her. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember.Alice and Taylor's mentally disturbed biological mother Samantha sneaks into the house to see her daughters and attacks Jessica. When the police arrive to arrest Samantha, Taylor confesses to texting her. Jessica then puts Alice and Chauncey to bed, and remarks that she had a similar childhood friend.Max leaves to embark on tour and Alice becomes hyper-focused on a scavenger hunt she claims was given to her by Chauncey. Chauncey's overwhelming presence in Alice's life begins to disturb Jessica. One day when Jessica leaves to visit Ben, Taylor invites an acquaintance over, Liam. Liam grabs a bottle of liquor which he accidentally shatters. He attempts to find a towel before being toyed with by Chauncey, who briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica arrives back home, angering Taylor.Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail prompting her to call a child psychologist named Dr. Soto. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey while also speaking on his behalf. Chauncey makes threatening remarks towards Jessica and Alice sobs over their crumbling friendship. Jessica later discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto then shows Jessica footage of a past patient who uses the same phrase as Alice: "Never Ever". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey which Taylor blames her stepmother for.Taylor meets Gloria, who tells her that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains to Taylor that imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned, which Jessica did with Chauncey. At home, Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and of the Never Ever. All three women complete the scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm to appear.In the Never Ever realm, the group find a door showing Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, Jessica was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but he became mad in the process after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Afterwards, Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm throughout her life. Gloria is savagely mauled by Chauncey when a door opens beside her. Jessica and Taylor rush off, searching for Alice. Both find Alice and attempt to escape while Chauncey pursues behind them. Jessica is able to stop Chauncey by stabbing him in the eye with scissors.After reuniting with Ben and Max at Ben's institution, Jessica realizes she is still stuck in the Never Ever. Chauncey used Alice as bait to get to Jessica and seeks revenge for her prior abandonment. Taylor arrives and saves Jessica. Chauncey turns to his true form akin to Simon. The spider tries to turn Jessica and Taylor insane with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire and seals him behind the door. The family escapes as the house burns to the ground.The family check into a hotel but are frightened by a child playing with his teddy bear who resembles Chauncey. The three leave to another hotel for their safety.</p>

                            <p>Description: Renowned Korean shaman and her protégé, Hwa-rim (Kim Go-eun) and Bong-gil (Lee Do-hyun) are enlisted by a wealthy Korean American family to identify the mysterious illness of the family's newborn son. Hwa-rim uncovers the curse to be a 'Grave's Call', a vengeful ancestor's spirit haunting them. The family's patriarch, Park Ji-yong, entrust them to relocate the grave to appease the ancestor, his grandfather. Hwa-rim enlists colleagues, a Feng shui master Kim Sang-deok (Choi Min-sik) and a mortician Yeong-geun (Yoo Hae-jin).Sang-deok specializes in selling burial locations for the wealthy, while Yeong-geun owns a funeral home. During their first encounter with Ji-yong, Sang-deok becomes wary when Ji-yong insists on cremating the grave, which is located in a remote mountain near the North Korean border. Sang-deok backs out, sensing a sinister energy. However, Hwa-rim convinces them that she can perform rituals while the grave is being dug to avoid the curse. Ji-yong tells them about a famous monk named 'Gisune,' who provided the grave location for his grandfather.Hwa-rim and Bong-gil perform the ritual, and the excavation proceeds smoothly. One of the grave-diggers severs the head of a human-headed snake, which triggers a bad omen. Yeong-geun insists on cremating the coffin once the rain stops so they store it at a nearby ward. The local custodian opens the coffin and releases the vengeful entity inside, Ji-yong's grandfather. The entity targets his bloodline, killing Ji-yong's parents and Ji-yong himself. The grandfather is revealed to be a Japanese loyalist during the Korean occupation era. Before he can reach the newborn baby, Sang-deok cremates the coffin, abolishing the curse.Months later, Yeong-geun informs Sang-deok about the disturbed gravedigger who killed a snake. He revisits the cursed gravesite and discovers the head of an 'onna' along with a double burial site for a seven-footed standing coffin. He enlists Hwa-rim, Bong-gil, and Yeong-geun to dispose of the coffin. The four excavate it and rest at a temple, where Hwa-rim learns about Gisune Monk, who is Japanese. That night, Bong-gil witnesses a seven-foot figure obliterating a human and pigs. They find the coffin ripped from the inside. Bong-gil gets possessed and the other three witness the creature turn into a ball of fire and fly back to the mountain. The four are taken to a hospital and Bong-gil recovers after surgery.Hwa-rim investigates the creature's origin through the possessed Bong-gil. Sang-deok returns to the grave and finds the creature dormant on the coordinates written on the tombstone. He discovers that the grave's robbers were Korean patriots attempting to unearth a metal pole as part of a Japanese military conquest in Korea. Sang-deok, Hwa-rim, and Yeong-geun devise to unearth the pole when the creature rises after midnight. Hwa-rim will distract the shogun while the others dig. A vision reveals Monk Kitsune embedding a katana inside a decapitated samurai's body, turning the samurai into a ghoul, with Ji-yong's grandfather's grave serving as a cover for the relic. Sang-deok realizes the pole is a sword embedded in the creature's body. Using the Korean patriots' wooden tool and blood, he slays the creature based on his elemental knowledge and regains consciousness with the others by his bedside. The four later attend Sang-deok's daughter's wedding.</p>

                            <p>Description: Johnny (Peter Butler) and Zuko (Bonko Khoza) were members of a group of armed activists called Alkebulan, determined to eradicate corruption in South Africa. Johnny was once a popular lawyer and the Director of International Relations, but when Daza Mtima (Sisanda Henna) was released from prison and gained power, Johnny got repeatedly demoted. Clearly, Johnny's stance did not align with Mtima's. He started a counterintelligence operation with elite assassins to take down Mtima, and Zuko was one of them.Zuko was born to activist parents and had grown up to always voice for the right cause. He had taken an oath during his initiation in which he promised to fight for justice and to protect the innocent. Johnny Klein found hope when he got access to files that exposed Mtima. Johnny trusted Zuko to ensure that Mtima was not exonerated by the courts, even though it had been a long time since Zuko had left the group.Johnny was diagnosed with cancer, and he had Mtima's PIA agents (reporting into Mo) tracking his every movement. However, Johnny managed to escape an attack when the PIA agents tracked the wrong person. Agent Naledi was on point for intel on Johnny's location.
Mtima is planning to fight an election and puts pressure on Mo to deliver Johnny to him.Johnny knew that he was running out of time, and the truth would be buried with him if Mtima found him before he could connect with Zuko. With time running out, Johnny met Zuko at his workplace. This meeting was observed by PIA agents. Zuko was not ready to leave behind the beautiful life he had built and endanger the future he envisioned with girlfriend Malime (and their son Pakamile), but he had a change of heart upon finding out that Johnny was suffering from a terminal illness.
Johnny handed him the key to the locker at the airport and instructed Zuko to head to Maseru, where he would find elders to show him the right path. Johnny distracted the PIA agents, while Zuko headed to the airport. Just when the agents thought they had succeeded in cornering Johnny, he shot himself and simultaneously jumped off the highway. Johnny had done his part for the welfare of South Africa. He had assigned Zuko the task of bringing out the truth, and he had also contacted Cape Town Sentinel journalist Mike Bressler (Deon Coetzee), whose career Mtima had ruined during his investigation into the state capture.Zuko had no choice but to bid goodbye to Malime (Masasa Mbangeni), knowing that their lives would be at risk if he continued to stay in touch with them. Malime never questioned Zuko about his past, but she could guess that he was in trouble when Johnny knocked at their door. Zuko chose not to disclose much about his life as an assassin, and when he suddenly decided to leave Malime was left wondering if he was just like all the other men who promised her the world but failed to live up to it.
Pakamile (Boleng Mogotsi) and Zuko shared a beautiful relationship, and he looked up to Zuko. He was the only one who knew that Zuko planned on proposing Malime and when he left all of a sudden, Pakamile did not lose hope. He had complete faith in Zuko and he was confident that he would return to their lives.
At the airport locker, Zuko found a passport and an flight ticket to Maseru.The PIA agents arrived at Malime's house and forcefully dragged her out. They wanted to find out more about the files Johnny had, and they believed that kidnapping Malime would help them stop Zuko. Malime barely had any knowledge about her partner's criminal past, but she tried to cooperate in the hopes of getting back to Pakamile.
Naledi (Nicole Fortuin), who was a member of the radical activist group, had infiltrated the PIA. Zuko contacted Naledi after he embarked on the mission. She advised him to focus on the task while she tried to find a way to make sure that his partner remained safe. She got in touch with Malime and tried to give her some hope.Unfortunately, Mo got a whiff of Naledi's true identity and interrogated her. Naledi refused to give away any information, and she was taken away to be further tortured. Mo was unaware of how skilled a fighter Naledi was, and it was only a matter of minutes before she managed to tackle the guards.
Naledi assisted Malime in escaping, but the entire situation was too overwhelming for Malime. The chaos and confusion resulted in Malime failing to land after jumping off a building to save her life. Malime did not survive the fall, and Mo decided to kidnap Pakamile to keep Zuko under pressure. Pakamile was in extreme pain after losing his mother all of a sudden and being locked up in a tiny room without any contact with his loved ones.
After escaping Naledi contacted Bressler. Naledi tells Bressler that Johhny and Zuko were running a counterintelligence operation against Mtima with elite assassins. She says that Malime died due to Mo.The Director of the PIA (Presidential Intelligence Agency), Molebogeng Kwena (Connie Ferguson), found out that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Thandiwe Makeba (Connie Chiume), was also involved with Johnny and his group. The connection between Makeba and Johnny was something Mo was keen on finding out.
She was surprised to learn that Mtima knew about Makeba's involvement, and he also had incriminating evidence against the former minister for her involvement in illegal mining. But even with the evidence against her, Makeba continued to be a threat to Mtima, and Mo was instructed to silence her. She had no choice but to obey Mtima because of her tainted past- her father was closely involved with the apartheid regime. Mo met Makeba to find out about Johnny's plan, but all the former politician disclosed was that Mtima would lose everything he had built by Friday.Thandi believed that it was her duty to protect South Africa from people like Mtima, who would not mind selling the nation for their own benefit. She and Johnny had created a deadly weapon, Zuko, to ensure that the innocent would not suffer from injustice. Thandi hoped for Mo to side with the cause after finding out about their pure intention, but it was all too late for Mo; she was already knee-deep in helping Mtima. Mo struck Thandi with a blunt object, and the former minister bled to death.Zuko felt reconnected with his ancestors when he reached Maseru and met the elders at the village. They tended to his wounds and handed him the letter Johnny had left for him. Zuko was reminded of the cause he was fighting for and how it was greater than everything else. He found the files Johnny had promised, and before releasing them to the public, he burned down the file of Alkebulan.
Just when Zuko accepted his role in the grand scheme of things, Mo informed him how every member of the group had been compromised. Zuko was furious when he found out that Malime met with an accident and Pakamile was kidnapped. He realized that the only way to stop Mtima was by exposing him, and he contacted Mike Bressler to hand over the files Johnny had left. They secretly met at a restaurant, and before handing over the documents, Zuko laid forth a condition: he was desperate to be reunited with his family, and he hoped for Bressler to help him.Bressler helped Zuko connect with Naledi, and it was from her that he found out about Malime's death. Zuko realized that before destroying Mtima, it was important that he get his son back. Naledi had been keeping track of Mo, and she had located a cabin she frequented. Bressler recognized the cabin; it was where Mtima lived when he visited Cape Town. Zuko broke into Mtima's cabin to seek his ultimate revenge.With the spear handed to him by his elders, Zuko slayed Mtima's guards one after the other. Mtima was easy to knock out, and by the time he came back to his senses, Zuko had his spear pressed on Mtima's throat. The presidential hopeful was well aware that Zuko was desperate to get his son back, and he knew that he would not be harmed as long as he had Pakamile. Zuko instructed Mo to get his son back, and in the meantime, Mtima tried to lure Zuko with money.Mtima's PIA agents arrived at the cabin, and what followed was an intense fight where Zuko triumphed. Mo brought along Pakamile to stop Zuko and force him to hand over the files. Zuko explained that he had already handed over the files for printing, and Mtima's political career was over. Mo was holding a gun, and she pointed it at Zuko. Mtima encouraged her to shoot him dead and prove to the world that she was not a traitor like her father. Mo crossed all boundaries, fearing being publicly shamed for her father's association with the apartheid regime, but she realized that as long as Mtima lived, there would never be an end to her misery.Mo shoots Mtima dead. She wanted to kill Zuko as well, but Naledi came to his rescue. Mo was shot dead, and it was all over for Mtima and his supporters.
The next morning, the murders of Daza Mtima and Molebogeng Kwena made it to the headlines. There were officially no suspects, suggesting that Zuko and Naledi had managed to walk away Scot-free. The files Johnny had gathered made it to the public, and those involved in the State capture were apprehended. While some sense of justice was brought into the world, Zuko headed back to his childhood home at the Great Fish River with his son by his side. He wanted to live a life of a recluse and dedicate all his time to farming, just like he and Pakamile had always planned.</p>

                            <p>Description: Oliwia (Anna Szymanczyk) worked as a chef in Wroclaw, and she was doing great in her career. For the last five years, her boss was dependent on her, and he knew that his cafe was so well known because of the exquisite dishes that Oliwia used to make.
One day, Oliwia got a call from her village, situated in the Podlaskie province, and she was informed that her grandmother had passed away. She asked her boss for a leave and rushed to her village immediately, as she knew that she was the only family member her grandmother had.
Oliwia's mother and grandmother used to fight all the time, and as a result, Oliwia never stayed a lot with her grandmother as her mother went off to live on the other side of the world.
Oliwia grew to up be a girl with a hot temper and no patience.Oliwia got the shock of her life when she realized that it was all an act, and her grandmother was pretty much alive. Her grandmother, Halina (Anna Seniuk), had lied to her, saying she wanted Oliwia to come back to the village and stay with her. Oliwia got mad at first, but then she realized that her grandmother missed her way too much. Oliwia's car was broken down (most probably it was messed up by one of the villagers to prompt Oliwia to stay the night).
Halina says that it was Oliwia's mother who turned her against her grandmother.
Still, Oliwia knew that she would go back in a couple of days, but she had no clue about what Halina had in her mind. She went missing just a day before Oliwia's departure, and she left a note for the latter, telling her that she was leaving her farm in her care. The farm had a horse named Dumpling which was bought for Oliwia when it was a colt.Oliwia was stuck, and additionally, she didn't know how to manage an entire farm. Luckily, she met a man who told her that he was Wojtek (Mateusz Janicki), the caretaker who generally provided a helping hand to Halina. Oliwia was glad that she found someone on whom she could put all the responsibilities and leave, but she had no clue that the entire village was conspiring together with Halina.
Oliwia meets her childhood friend Matylda Wasyl (Angelika Cegielska-Swiatek), and they used to go apple picking together. Matylda is with the local police and tells Oliwia that Halina is alive and well and is using the internet at Matylda's house to keep tabs on Oliwia.Eventually, Oliwia starts riding Dumpling and enjoying the farm life. Wojtek even fixes her car. Oliwia bonds with her farm animals when a recently born baby goat got sick and really weak. Oliwia had to feed the baby goat by herself to save her life.
The town had many colorful characters including 2 brothers who brewed their own moonshine. Oliwia suggests them to mix their flavors to create an even more amazing brew.Everybody knew that Halina was hiding in Jan's (Artur Barcis) house, but no one informed Oliwia about it, as they, too, wanted her to stay back with her grandmother. The man who said he was Wojtek was actually the owner of the Herbal World, and his real name was Kuba Wolak. Kuba made sure that Olivia's car didn't start the next day, hoping that it would coerce her to stay back.Although Oliwia was annoyed when her car didn't start, she decided to see the brighter side of things. She knew she had a hectic life in the city, and she realized that it wouldn't be such a bad thing to stay back and take some downtime. Halina was happy that her plan was working, and she wished and hoped that her granddaughter would stay there for good.
Oliwia gets a hang of farm work, including the milking of goats. Matylda comes by and convinces her to take a longer vacation from work. Her boss is distraught but gives her another week.Now, firstly, Kuba had lied about his identity, and secondly, Oliwia got to know that he was an arch-nemesis of her grandmother. Oliwia got to know that, first, Kuba and his father had filed a suit against her grandmother for the damages (to tune of 25,000 Zlotys) caused to their business.
Oliwia's mother had sold their meadow to Kuba's father, and this is what Halina and Oliwia's mother fought about, as the meadow was sold without Halina's consent.
Oliwia realizes that man she thought was Wojtek is really Kuba. She had gone with an offer to sell the entire farm for 150,000 Zoltys, but Kuba tells Oliwia that Halina can earn that money from the farm to pay of her debts.Oliwia realized that maybe Kuba was a monopolist, and he was envious of the fact that Halina's cheese production business was doing so well. Halina won awards every year for her product, and it was said that her cheese was the best in the entire region. This is when the health department had come for inspection at Halina's farm, and after that, they had put a ban on the production of cheese.Halina's cheese was of the best quality, and it felt like either the health inspector had a grudge against her, or somebody had bribed him or used their influence to destroy Halina's business. The suspicion fell on Kuba, as he was the one who had these legal battles going on. Kuba had fallen for Oliwia, and he wanted to tell her that he was not the person she believed him to be. Kuba tried telling Oliwia that it was all a big misunderstanding. He told her that he had not called the health department, and in fact, it was Halina who had filed a complaint against him at first.Kuba had separated from his wife sometime back, and his girl stayed with him. Kuba wanted things to work out between him and Oliwia, and so one day, on the advice of his daughter, he decided to express his feelings to her. Oliwia also liked Kuba, but the fact was that she was never going to stay in the village, and a long-distance relationship was something that she felt was not doable.
Kuba tried to approach Oliwia, but he was stopped by Halina's friends who did not want Oliwia mixing up with Halina's arch-nemesis.
Oliwia restarts making cheese from goat milk, using Halina's recipe. The first batch is only so-so. Kuba's daughter comes by and suggests that Oliwia can improve the taste using herbs from Kuba's herb garden. Oliwia becomes best friends with Kuba's daughter and learns that Kuba is in love with her.Over a period of time, Kuba realized that not only did he have a strong bond with Oliwia on a personal level, but they were also too good when it came to professional partnerships. One time, people from Warsaw were coming to meet Kuba as they saw potential in his herb world initiative, and they wanted to invest money in the new venture that he was going to open in Bialystok. At the last moment, Kuba realized that his father had fired the chef and there was nobody to cook food for them. He asked Oliwia to help him out, and considering she was a professional chef, she made the most delicious lunch for the guests. The Varsovians were impressed, and they decided to invest money in Kuba's venture.When Halina came back from hiding, she got to know that it was a lady named Maryla Jura (Beata Kawka) who had snitched and informed the health department.
Halina accepted Kuba and Oliwia's relationship, as she knew that there was a possibility that because of Kuba, Oliwia might stay back. But Oliwia was a practical girl, and she decided that her life was in the city. She had huge dreams, and so to fulfill them once again, with tears in her eyes, she went back.
Kuba stood there on his farm, watching Oliwia drive her car away. He wanted to stop her; he wanted to tell her how much he needed her in his life, but he knew that he couldn't do that. Kuba knew that their relationship wouldn't be sustainable if he forced her to stay. Kuba wanted her to get the realization, and he was prepared that probably she wouldn't ever return to the village.But something happened to Oliwia once she got back to her city. She felt a void inside her, and she just couldn't focus on anything.
Yes, her career was there, but there was nobody around her whom she could call her own. She craved her grandmother's presence; she longed to be with Kuba, and she felt deprived of that warmth that she got there from everybody else.That's when Oliwia decided to go back to her village. It was a tough decision for her, but she was very clear about her priorities. In the end, Kuba was elated when he found that Oliwia had come back, and he just couldn't stop blushing when he heard the hooves of her horse approaching him.

                            <p>Description: Renowned Korean shaman and her protégé, Hwa-rim (Kim Go-eun) and Bong-gil (Lee Do-hyun) are enlisted by a wealthy Korean American family to identify the mysterious illness of the family's newborn son. Hwa-rim uncovers the curse to be a 'Grave's Call', a vengeful ancestor's spirit haunting them. The family's patriarch, Park Ji-yong, entrust them to relocate the grave to appease the ancestor, his grandfather. Hwa-rim enlists colleagues, a Feng shui master Kim Sang-deok (Choi Min-sik) and a mortician Yeong-geun (Yoo Hae-jin).Sang-deok specializes in selling burial locations for the wealthy, while Yeong-geun owns a funeral home. During their first encounter with Ji-yong, Sang-deok becomes wary when Ji-yong insists on cremating the grave, which is located in a remote mountain near the North Korean border. Sang-deok backs out, sensing a sinister energy. However, Hwa-rim convinces them that she can perform rituals while the grave is being dug to avoid the curse. Ji-yong tells them about a famous monk named 'Gisune,' who provided the grave location for his grandfather.Hwa-rim and Bong-gil perform the ritual, and the excavation proceeds smoothly. One of the grave-diggers severs the head of a human-headed snake, which triggers a bad omen. Yeong-geun insists on cremating the coffin once the rain stops so they store it at a nearby ward. The local custodian opens the coffin and releases the vengeful entity inside, Ji-yong's grandfather. The entity targets his bloodline, killing Ji-yong's parents and Ji-yong himself. The grandfather is revealed to be a Japanese loyalist during the Korean occupation era. Before he can reach the newborn baby, Sang-deok cremates the coffin, abolishing the curse.Months later, Yeong-geun informs Sang-deok about the disturbed gravedigger who killed a snake. He revisits the cursed gravesite and discovers the head of an 'onna' along with a double burial site for a seven-footed standing coffin. He enlists Hwa-rim, Bong-gil, and Yeong-geun to dispose of the coffin. The four excavate it and rest at a temple, where Hwa-rim learns about Gisune Monk, who is Japanese. That night, Bong-gil witnesses a seven-foot figure obliterating a human and pigs. They find the coffin ripped from the inside. Bong-gil gets possessed and the other three witness the creature turn into a ball of fire and fly back to the mountain. The four are taken to a hospital and Bong-gil recovers after surgery.Hwa-rim investigates the creature's origin through the possessed Bong-gil. Sang-deok returns to the grave and finds the creature dormant on the coordinates written on the tombstone. He discovers that the grave's robbers were Korean patriots attempting to unearth a metal pole as part of a Japanese military conquest in Korea. Sang-deok, Hwa-rim, and Yeong-geun devise to unearth the pole when the creature rises after midnight. Hwa-rim will distract the shogun while the others dig. A vision reveals Monk Kitsune embedding a katana inside a decapitated samurai's body, turning the samurai into a ghoul, with Ji-yong's grandfather's grave serving as a cover for the relic. Sang-deok realizes the pole is a sword embedded in the creature's body. Using the Korean patriots' wooden tool and blood, he slays the creature based on his elemental knowledge and regains consciousness with the others by his bedside. The four later attend Sang-deok's daughter's wedding.</p>

                            <p>Description: Goldy and Marla are excited about the fun nature of their latest catering gig, a by invitation only medieval ball and dinner at Sir Alistair Harrows' home, Hyde Castle, it a fundraiser for Elk Park Prep Academy, the school that Olive attends, she who will be part of a fencing demonstration at the gala. A stickler for authenticity as his home is one big medieval castle without the latest technology such as computers, Internet or cell phones, Sir Alistair dictates to his butler Klaus that all the guests must be dressed in medieval costume, and only invited guests are to be allowed in. Among the guests are many from the Elk Park Police Department, including Tom, Mason and Dave. One uninvited person who is able to make his way in, just before a storm snows them all in, is US Marshal Gerard Trach, Dave's father, who has come to see Tom to question him about his convict father Edmund Schultz as he has escaped from prison, odd in that he would soon be eligible for parole after twenty-five years served for murder. Tom knows nothing about Edmund's whereabouts as he has not spoken to his father since he went to prison, with this news dampening his spirit just before he and Goldy are to go on a big date. Something else that dampens the entire evening is a murder, the victim who was just about to make a self-described earth-shattering announcement. Tom leads the investigation, with Mason and Dave providing official assistance, Gerard somewhat unofficial assistance, and Goldy her inherent sleuthing skills. Even if they don't know the nature of the victim's announcement, they discover that there are many possible suspects as the victim had many enemies among the guests who can't leave even if they wanted to because of the snow. But what Tom probably did not expect is that his father would factor into the proceedings.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: The film opens with a young Robert Nesta Marley (Nolan Collignon) joining his mother as they take a bus from one home to another. This is followed by text explaining how Bob Marley is still known today as Jamaica's biggest star. He grew up from humble beginnings around a time of violence in Jamaica during the 70s after the nation gained its independence from Great Britain.Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), already well into his career, goes to a press conference after announcing that he is planning to hold a peace concert, "Smile Jamaica", to unite the nation in the face of political discourse. Some critics fear that Bob is making it look like his is taking a side.Kingston, 1976 - Bob is playing soccer with his friends and sons when thugs start firing their guns in the streets. Bob protects his sons and takes them away, telling them not to worry about what happened (this is also where he starts to come up with "Three Little Birds"). They return to their home, where Bob talks to his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch), as the constant threat of violence around their family puts her on edge.Later, Bob goes to rehearse "I Shot The Sheriff" with his group, The Wailers. Rita steps out momentarily and sees two gunmen running towards the house, while a third aims his gun at her head. The two men enter the house and shoot at Bob and his friend Don Taylor (Anthony Welsh), while Rita has also been shot. Despite his injury, Bob rises to his feet and gets Don and Rita to the hospital. Bob sits by Rita's bedside as she lies unconscious. He reminisces about when they were teenagers (played by Quan-Dajai Henrique and Nia Ashi) and Bob began to court Rita.Following their recoveries, Bob still plans on going forward with the concert. Everyone close to him sees it as a bad idea for his safety and his family's, but he insists on doing it. On the night of the show, Bob goes and performs, but he briefly hallucinates seeing the gunman that shot him in the crowd. He then stops the show and reveals his injuries to the crowd before walking off the stage. Rita tries to comfort him, and Bob says he needs time to himself.Three months later, Bob travels to London with some of his friends. While there, they are arrested for possession of cannabis. In jail, Bob recalls how Rita first brought him into the Rastafari movement. He also thinks about witnessing his father abandon him and his mother when he was a child, and he refused to acknowledge Bob as his son.Later, Bob talks to his producer Chris Blackwell (James Norton) over ideas for a new album. Rita joins him in London while Bob and the Wailers are trying to come up with a new sound. Bob listens to the soundtrack to the film "Exodus" and starts to come up with his own song of the same name. With help from publicist Howard Bloom (Michael Gandolfini), the group makes their next album, "Exodus", which becomes a worldwide best-selling hit.Following the album's success, Bob goes on a tour throughout Europe in 1977. Although he sees much more success and popularity, Bob is seen engaging in an affair with a woman, Cindy Breakspeare (Umi Myers). During a pickup game of soccer, Bob is seen stumbling after an injury, but he brushes it off.Chris invites Bob and company to an event. While there, Bob gets jealous at seeing Rita talking to another man. When he goes outside to confront her, she in turn hits back at him with the knowledge of his own multiple affairs and the children he has produced as a result.

                            <p>Description: Overly regimented and risk-averse San Francisco-based Madeline Zekko is planning her and her fiancé Jason Reid's honeymoon to Niagara Falls to take place in five weeks time, Madeline not leaving a second free in the itinerary in wanting to recreate her grandparents' love story there. Instead, Jason, who wants some spontaneity in life and accusing Madeline of not having a spontaneous bone in her body, breaks up with her. Madeline's divorced sister Harley is ultimately able to convince Madeline to take that pre-paid, non-refundable honeymoon trip with her to show Jason that she can indeed be spontaneous. When Madeline and Harley arrive at the tour company's office on their second day in Niagara Falls, Madeline is dismayed to see that their tour guide for the week Mike Hollis, the man with who she had a less than pleasant encounter the day before. With Mike's boss and best friend Emily Henley unable to take over Madeline's tours in working on her own tours for her brother Keegan's best friend Phil and his fiancée Beth who will be getting married at the end of the week, Emily is able to convince both Madeline and Mike to give going on the tours together a try. Mike is further able to convince Madeline to change the itinerary somewhat to incorporate adventure activities, Mike's preferred ones as opposed to the plethora of romance tours that are their bread and butter, again to demonstrate to Jason that she is not totally stuck in her box. In the process with Mike opening up about his two year heartache in who he thought was the one leaving him, Madeline and Mike see a different side of the other as they start to fall for each other, Phil and Beth who end up being a sounding board in being able to provide some insight into why their relationship works.

                            <p>Description: Set in the northern snowy landscapes of Sweden, Sami family prepares their young daughter for her earmark ceremony, which is an important tradition in their culture. The young girl, Elsa (Elin Kristina Oskal), is equally excited and scared of what she has to do, as she wants to feel one with her people but also does not want to hurt any of their animals.
As her father shows her the many calves she can choose from, Elsa picks up a beautiful baby reindeer with white fur and a mark on its head. She lovingly names it Nastegallu. In the weeks following the ceremony, Elsa and Nastegallu grow very close to each other, as the animal shows all signs of love and submission to her. Despite her father's warnings, little Elsa also showers the reindeer with grass and other treats. Elsa is a natural reindeer herder.
Lasse (Pvva Pittja) is Elsa's brother and Nils-Johan (Magnus Kuhmunen) is her father.But the occupation has been growing increasingly tough for the Sami people because people of other ethnicity and cultures living in the nearby areas do not respect the animals at all. In fact, a group of hunters has been killing the reindeer. Tragedy strikes for Elsa when she suddenly sees a man kill Nastegallu with a knife attack at the reindeer grazing grounds, but she has to hide in fear. The killer sees Elsa and threatens to kill her, too, if she ever speaks up about it.
By the time the girl's father, uncle, and brother reach the scene, it is too late to catch the killer. The next day, Elsa's father takes her to the nearest police station to file a complaint against the perpetrator, and incidentally, she sees the same man at the place, having a friendly chat with the officers. Shocked and scared for her own safety, Elsa does not say anything about seeing the killer in action to the police officer . The police officially report Nastegallu as having been stolen, as they refuse to accept charges of slaughter.Ten years pass by, and Elsa is now a young adult, having taken on the role of a teacher at the local school. She is as loving and protective of her culture and identity as a Sami woman, and so she is still threatened by the constant butchering of reindeer, which is still not investigated or punished. To this day, Elsa regrets not speaking up about the perpetrator despite having recognized him as their neighbor, Robert Isaksson (Martin Wallstrom). As the woman intends to somehow punish the man for his crimes, more troubling situations are posed against the Sami people.
Niila (Niila Emanuel Omma) is the son of the Reindeer King and is interested in Elsa.Sami people are entirely dependent on the herds of reindeer that they own, as their whole life is driven by the animals. As they rear the animals for skin, fur, and meat and also rely on these products as a means of trade, the indigenous people would be very clueless without the existence of the reindeer. Moreover, the practice of herding reindeer and the associated activities with it are all part of the Sami's culture, which is severely endangered at this point in time. Due to climate changes and deforestation, it is increasingly difficult to sustain the herds. Lasse even took up a job at the mines in town of Kiruna.For people of other cultures living in the nearby regions, the reindeer is nothing more than a hassle, for they are forced to shape their lives according to the animals' needs. Because of the close connection between the creatures and the Sami people, which are officially declared endangered, the government has also made certain rules to help both sets survive better. As a result, the others in the area have to abide by laws, such as not being able to use snowmobiles during certain seasons and having to stay clear of the paths used by the reindeer during their migration from summer to winter pastures. With no concern for the animals or the Sami people, the likes of Robert Isaksson keep harping about how their lives are being affected by the animals and the rules surrounding their conservation in an attempt to get rid of them.As a result, the feeling of xenophobia is greatly on the rise among these communities, as they genuinely disrespect the Sami people, their culture, and their way of life. To make matters worse, most of the officials in the police and administration, if not all, are Swedish or Caucasians, meaning that they, too, are not bothered by the killings of the reindeer and the overall discrimination that the Sami face.Robert Isaksson takes the most daring and vile step of killing the reindeer in order to both run a business and also disrespect the Sami in the region. Robert runs an illegal reindeer hunting and meat trade, because of which he shoots down and kills numerous animals, but he is also not like any usual hunter. The man is boastful and brash with his killings, sometimes torturing and teasing the animals, even injuring and killing one with his snowmobile in one instance. He is egoistic as well, which leads to extreme anger and frustration in him often, especially with regards to the Sami people having a say in how things in the region should operate. Robert and his men kill multiple animals and make a crude altar out of the dead bodies, mocking the Sami people and their way of life. They also put the reindeer fodder on fire, destroying expensive supplies while even making a video of it and ridiculing the owners.One day Elsa followed the snowmobile tracks after she heard shots. And she reached a shed that belonged to Robert. Else calls the police, but they don't have a warrant to enter Robert's property. Robert claims that the Sami tribes are killing their own reindeer and claiming theft compensation from the Government.Along with the external problems that the group has to face, Elsa is also bitter and disgruntled with the reactions of the very people in her tribe, as they are too soft and ineffective in protecting their rights. The elected leader of the Sami in the region, Olle (Simon Issat Marainen), is clearly not stern enough in his negotiations, and he is also rather sexist, as he does not want a woman, especially a young one like Elsa, to be so vocal about their problems. Elsa is understandably frustrated by this situation, and she even seriously considers leaving the village to pursue higher education as she starts to feel that there is no way forward for her people.The village council soon has a meeting with representatives of all the families living in the area as the matter of a mining business being opened is discussed. The Sami people naturally object to it, as the existence of a large mine in the middle of the route used by their reindeer would cause trouble for the animals. Moreover, the mine would also pollute the water and air, along with the land, which would very quickly give rise to other environmental degradation. However, the others in the area complain that their benefits should also be considered at times. With laws against hunting and fishing, the mine would be the only major opportunity for employment in the village, which is highly required for the livelihood of these people. In this meeting, Elsa's frustration boils over, and she directly addresses the committee, speaking about the importance of the reindeer for her people.
Lasse is depressed at working over in the mines and commits suicide. On the day of his funeral, Elsa runs into Robert and warns him to stop killing the reindeer.
Later that day, the family attends a traditional Sami fair, and Elsa has sex with Niila.A false narrative, that the Sami people themselves kill their reindeer in order to get government compensation, is being floated around, and Elsa is terribly angered by it. She decides to speak out and give a whole interview to one of the news channels, which is published in the next day's newspaper. This further shocks Olle, and he finally bars Elsa from attending meetings.Elsa starts to speak up against the vile nature of Robert and his followers and even regularly reports the killings to the police, Isaksson is furious and wants his revenge. Sometime later, when Robert Isaksson kills multiple reindeer and makes a mocking altar out of their skulls by the side of the highway, news TV channels from the nearby towns report on the incident.
One day Elsa and Niila finds Robert driving a snowmobile through their protected reindeer pastures. Niila confronts Robert, but is assaulted by Robert with Niila's own gun.In a drunken state, he goes over to Elsa's house to threaten her. He breaks into the house on the very night that Elsa's parents are away, and her brother is drunk. He chases her down only because he did not like her tone when she had threatened him the previous day. It is only because Elsa cleverly manages to hide in the basement and also inform the police about the intruder in her house that she survives the night.Elsa sneaks into Robert's warehouse and photographs everything she sees inside it as proof of the illegal meat trade that was going on. Robert had security cameras installed all over the place, and as soon as he monitors an intrusion on his property, he returns to the place. A tense chase follows, with Robert surely intending to kill Elsa if he can get his hands on her.However, the whole situation changes as Robert loses control of his snowmobile and lands on top of a defrosting water body. The heavy weight and impact of the crash make the ice break, and the man falls into the freezing cold water. With his leg already injured by the crash, Robert is unable to swim up and immediately drowns and dies.Despite her anger against the man, Elsa had finally decided to help him, even throwing a rope towards him, but she was unable to save him. A police investigation into the matter soon led to the arrest of other men who had been part of the meat trade.Else moves on with her life and teaches her culture to other members of the tribe, including the process of cutting off the reindeer's ear tip, suggesting that she continues to spread her culture through generations after having protected her people from the vile Robert Isaksson.</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2014, in Costa Rica, Michael Light, an American runner, and his adventure racing team gets stuck on the first day after their leader takes the poor decision to kayak against the tide. Leo, one of the members of the team, is outraged that Michael has not paid attention to their opinions.After a 3 year lapse in his career, in 2018, Michael is not satisfied with himself and decides to race one more time with the hope of winning a race at last. He chooses two of his teammates: Olivia, a climber, whose father made a career in the same discipline; and Chik, an older racer, whose recovery from a knee injury is uncertain. However his sponsor imposes the 4th team member, Leo, Michael's original team member, and now a social media celebrity; and, much against his own will, Light accepts. They fly from the USA to the Dominican Republic for a 5-day race mostly through mountainous jungle terrain. On the second day of the race Michael gives meatballs to a stray dog at the transition camp. Much further ahead in the race, in the middle of the jungle, the dog finds them and does not stop following them. During their walk at night the dog saves Leo and the Team from falling off a cliff and they all adopt him as one of them and call him Arthur, the King. For the last part of the competition, and while they are leading the race, however, they have to leave Arthur on shore to kayak on sea. But as they see the dog is about to drown while following them, they go back and save him. The team is thus delayed and loses the race, arriving second. Arthur collapses on arrival and a veterinary finds he is severely infected by parasites, advising to put him to sleep to prevent further suffering, which Michael refuses. He manages to take him to the USA, where the dog is saved.The last scene, 18 months later, shows them running together on a ridge.</p>

                            <p>Description: Rudy's (Rudy Mancuso) life is somewhat of a mess and his girlfriend Haley (Francesca Reale) is tired of him zoning out on her. Rudy's Brazilian mother Maria (Maria Mancuso) doesn't like the white girl anyway, and so when she hears that Haley has broken up with Rudy, she thinks it's the perfect opportunity to introduce him to women of his own heritage, the beautiful Brazilians.
Rudy hears music in everything; it's almost like a form of therapy for him, and his escape from the real world. When he walks down the subway steps, it's a piano. When he sits in a diner with his girlfriend, he can't help but be distracted by the music of cooking and serving. This is exactly why Haley doesn't feel like he cares for her at all.
Additionally, he's always dividing his attention between her and his mother, so she feels unseen.Rudy is in his last year of school, and his only interests are puppets and music, something Haley doesn't understand. She wants him to become more serious in life and get a real job when they live together at university (which happens in 6 weeks). Rudy spends most of his time working on these "hobbies" and works late into the morning down in the subway for some petty cash, which doesn't really help his cause. Haley and Rudy have been together for 4 years. Rudy does puppet shows in the subway and is working on his music thesis. But Haley doesn't believe that Rudy has made enough progress.Plus, he lives at home with his mother. But at least that means he always has a lot of food on his plate. Being broken up makes Rudy realize he should take things a bit seriously. He tries to study hard, but it doesn't really work. Maria sets Rudy up with a nice Brazilian girl named Luana (Camila Senna), which is really embarrassing for him. Luana is really aggressive in her approach, but Rudy pushes her back. This prompts Luana to walk away, telling Maria that Rudy needs help.
His mother sends him to buy fish one day, and there, like the feeling of spring after a cold winter, he sees Isabella (Camila Mendes), a Brazilian. Isabella woks at the fish market and gaping at her Rudy is hit in the face with a fish.Rudy returns to the store later and walks Isabella to a market fair that she was planning on visiting. Isabella is very different from Haley. She's actually interested in seeing the world through Rudy's eyes. Rudy shows how he can turn everyday regular sounds into a rhythm.
Isabella suggests Rudy take his show "up" and actually work on it. In the meantime, at school, Haley notices him trying to ask questions in class (it's only because it's about music). Haley tells Rudy that she wants to give another shot to their relationship.Now Rudy is stuck between his ex of four years, who wants to make things work out, and a fresh perspective, who is more understanding of him because of their matching backgrounds. Isabella tells him how her mother abandoned her when she was 15, and she went back to Brazil for a man. Rudy spends a lot of time chit-chatting with his puppet about Isabella.Anwar (J.B. Smoove) is Rudy's friend and runs a fast-food truck. Rudy confides in Anwar that at this point he finds both Isabella and Haley equally alluring. Anwar asks him to pursue both, while his puppet advises strongly against it.One night, when he's trying to take Isabella out on a date using his friend's truck, he ends up getting shot in the arm. It's only grazing, but this gets Isabella and Rudy closer. They share a kiss and admit that they both feel connected to each other. She covers Rudy's ears when he goes to his faraway place and calms him down.Still, somehow, Rudy ends up two-timing the two girls "by accident". While things are going wonderfully with Isabella, he ends up going to Haley's house for a meal, which goes terribly. Her parents (Bruce (Gregory Jones) and Claire (Regina Schneider)) are racist and don't see how he's right for their daughter.
Rudy asks to meet Haley at a Brazilian restaurant in his part of town to break up with her. Isabella happens to be in the same restaurant getting takeout. Somehow, this doesn't knock some sense into Rudy, and he ends up trying to divide his time between the two girls.
In the end, his mother shows up, and the three women surround him in the middle of the restaurant. Rudy, who explodes finally, revealing to Haley that he invited her there to break up with her because he found "another woman." Unfortunately, Isabella doesn't care if she's the chosen one; she leaves the restaurant.After a drunken night makes Rudy hallucinate that his life is a routine mess, his mother tries to knock some sense into Rudy. She asks him what he wants in life, and he lists a few things. One is to be happy; the other is to spend time with his mother, his puppets and music, and ultimately Isabella. She's kind of his savior, or that's what the dream made it seem like.
Rudy writes a song for Isabella to apologize, but she asks him to speak to her like a real adult. She tells him that he's trying hard to keep something together that he doesn't even know if he really wants. His apology doesn't work because Isabella has always been left with her feelings ignored.It's time for Rudy to submit his thesis, but instead, he turns it into a script titled "Musica," inspired by his own life. Finally, Rudy takes his show above ground and presents a comedy show with his puppets recreating scenes from his life with music and laughter.
Ultimately, after his show is a success, he receives takeout with a smiley face on the cover. This is the same smiley face Isabella drew for him after he got smacked by a piece of fish in the face.</p>

He now starts a new life in Hokkaido. To raise money for his plan, he pans for gold in Hokkaido. He hears about the existence of gold nuggets that belonged to the indigenous Ainu people, but were stolen by a man known as Noppera-bo. Right before he was caught, Noppera-bo allegedly hid the gold nuggets. In prison, Noppera-bo tattooed the secret location among the bodies of 24 different prisoners. Each prisoner had a piece that would collectively reveal the location of the gold nuggets. Noppera-bo then escaped prison with those 24 prisoners. One day, Saichi Sugimoto is attacked by a wild bear. At that time, he is saved by an Ainu girl named Asirpa (Anna Yamada). Asirpa's father was killed by the man who stole the gold nuggets and she wants to take revenge on her father's killer. Saichi Sugimoto and Asirpa, for different reasons, begin to work together. More people join the chase for the hidden gold nuggets.—AsianWiki</p>

                            <p>Description: Amanda Raymond moved back to her family's flower farm after her father Craig Raymond's passing a year ago. That milestone not only was to help her mother Grace Raymond run the farm, but led to her turning her back on the church for God taking her father away from them. Amanda and Grace are facing problems this Easter season, one of their most economically profitable seasons of the year, with the unseasonable cold weather meaning no flowers yet. Behind on the mortgage payment, they are at risk of losing the farm, Craig's legacy. While Craig was the floral designer in the family, Amanda, who has no training or natural ability at such, works toward a Hail Mary in planning to enter the annual Easter statewide flower arranging competition, the $20,000 first prize which would tie them over financially. The only reason why Amanda is considering it is because Lori Matthews, a trained now retired florist who has just moved to town and who Amanda helped out of a bind in their first meeting, has offered to be her teacher. Many of Lori's lessons take them away from the floral table, sometimes to the church where her son Derrick Matthews is the new pastor, that initial entrance back into the church still being a painful one for Amanda. Both Lori and Derrick are facing their own demons, one which Lori may have to face in moving to town, and one Derrick has run away from in moving to town. In the process of the floral competition, their collective issues may come to a head as Amanda and Derrick start to fall for each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Within the walls of the Grave, the orphanage where Nica grew up, a legend has always been told: that of the maker of tears, a mysterious craftsman, guilty of crafting all the fears and anxieties that inhabit the hearts of men. But at seventeen years old, the time has come for Nica to leave fairy tales behind. Her biggest dream is about to come true. Mr and Mrs Milligan have started the adoption process and are ready to give her the family she has always wanted. In her new home, however, Nica is not alone. Along with her, Rigel, a restless and mysterious orphan, the last person in the world Nica would want as an adoptive brother, is also taken from the Grave. Rigel is intelligent, smart, plays the piano like an enchanting demon and has a beauty that can enchant, but his angelic appearance conceals a dark nature. Even though Nica and Rigel are united by a common past of pain and hardship, living together seems impossible, but kindness and anger are two different ways of fighting pain to stay alive and to conceal the emotions that devastate their hearts, becoming for each other that tears-maker of legend. To the maker of tears you cannot lie: and they will have to find the courage to accept that desperate force that attract them towards each other called love.</p>

                            <p>Description: Johnny (Peter Butler) and Zuko (Bonko Khoza) were members of a group of armed activists called Alkebulan, determined to eradicate corruption in South Africa. Johnny was once a popular lawyer and the Director of International Relations, but when Daza Mtima (Sisanda Henna) was released from prison and gained power, Johnny got repeatedly demoted. Clearly, Johnny's stance did not align with Mtima's. He started a counterintelligence operation with elite assassins to take down Mtima, and Zuko was one of them.Zuko was born to activist parents and had grown up to always voice for the right cause. He had taken an oath during his initiation in which he promised to fight for justice and to protect the innocent. Johnny Klein found hope when he got access to files that exposed Mtima. Johnny trusted Zuko to ensure that Mtima was not exonerated by the courts, even though it had been a long time since Zuko had left the group.Johnny was diagnosed with cancer, and he had Mtima's PIA agents (reporting into Mo) tracking his every movement. However, Johnny managed to escape an attack when the PIA agents tracked the wrong person. Agent Naledi was on point for intel on Johnny's location.
Mtima is planning to fight an election and puts pressure on Mo to deliver Johnny to him.Johnny knew that he was running out of time, and the truth would be buried with him if Mtima found him before he could connect with Zuko. With time running out, Johnny met Zuko at his workplace. This meeting was observed by PIA agents. Zuko was not ready to leave behind the beautiful life he had built and endanger the future he envisioned with girlfriend Malime (and their son Pakamile), but he had a change of heart upon finding out that Johnny was suffering from a terminal illness.
Johnny handed him the key to the locker at the airport and instructed Zuko to head to Maseru, where he would find elders to show him the right path. Johnny distracted the PIA agents, while Zuko headed to the airport. Just when the agents thought they had succeeded in cornering Johnny, he shot himself and simultaneously jumped off the highway. Johnny had done his part for the welfare of South Africa. He had assigned Zuko the task of bringing out the truth, and he had also contacted Cape Town Sentinel journalist Mike Bressler (Deon Coetzee), whose career Mtima had ruined during his investigation into the state capture.Zuko had no choice but to bid goodbye to Malime (Masasa Mbangeni), knowing that their lives would be at risk if he continued to stay in touch with them. Malime never questioned Zuko about his past, but she could guess that he was in trouble when Johnny knocked at their door. Zuko chose not to disclose much about his life as an assassin, and when he suddenly decided to leave Malime was left wondering if he was just like all the other men who promised her the world but failed to live up to it.
Pakamile (Boleng Mogotsi) and Zuko shared a beautiful relationship, and he looked up to Zuko. He was the only one who knew that Zuko planned on proposing Malime and when he left all of a sudden, Pakamile did not lose hope. He had complete faith in Zuko and he was confident that he would return to their lives.
At the airport locker, Zuko found a passport and an flight ticket to Maseru.The PIA agents arrived at Malime's house and forcefully dragged her out. They wanted to find out more about the files Johnny had, and they believed that kidnapping Malime would help them stop Zuko. Malime barely had any knowledge about her partner's criminal past, but she tried to cooperate in the hopes of getting back to Pakamile.
Naledi (Nicole Fortuin), who was a member of the radical activist group, had infiltrated the PIA. Zuko contacted Naledi after he embarked on the mission. She advised him to focus on the task while she tried to find a way to make sure that his partner remained safe. She got in touch with Malime and tried to give her some hope.Unfortunately, Mo got a whiff of Naledi's true identity and interrogated her. Naledi refused to give away any information, and she was taken away to be further tortured. Mo was unaware of how skilled a fighter Naledi was, and it was only a matter of minutes before she managed to tackle the guards.
Naledi assisted Malime in escaping, but the entire situation was too overwhelming for Malime. The chaos and confusion resulted in Malime failing to land after jumping off a building to save her life. Malime did not survive the fall, and Mo decided to kidnap Pakamile to keep Zuko under pressure. Pakamile was in extreme pain after losing his mother all of a sudden and being locked up in a tiny room without any contact with his loved ones.
After escaping Naledi contacted Bressler. Naledi tells Bressler that Johhny and Zuko were running a counterintelligence operation against Mtima with elite assassins. She says that Malime died due to Mo.The Director of the PIA (Presidential Intelligence Agency), Molebogeng Kwena (Connie Ferguson), found out that the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Thandiwe Makeba (Connie Chiume), was also involved with Johnny and his group. The connection between Makeba and Johnny was something Mo was keen on finding out.
She was surprised to learn that Mtima knew about Makeba's involvement, and he also had incriminating evidence against the former minister for her involvement in illegal mining. But even with the evidence against her, Makeba continued to be a threat to Mtima, and Mo was instructed to silence her. She had no choice but to obey Mtima because of her tainted past- her father was closely involved with the apartheid regime. Mo met Makeba to find out about Johnny's plan, but all the former politician disclosed was that Mtima would lose everything he had built by Friday.Thandi believed that it was her duty to protect South Africa from people like Mtima, who would not mind selling the nation for their own benefit. She and Johnny had created a deadly weapon, Zuko, to ensure that the innocent would not suffer from injustice. Thandi hoped for Mo to side with the cause after finding out about their pure intention, but it was all too late for Mo; she was already knee-deep in helping Mtima. Mo struck Thandi with a blunt object, and the former minister bled to death.Zuko felt reconnected with his ancestors when he reached Maseru and met the elders at the village. They tended to his wounds and handed him the letter Johnny had left for him. Zuko was reminded of the cause he was fighting for and how it was greater than everything else. He found the files Johnny had promised, and before releasing them to the public, he burned down the file of Alkebulan.
Just when Zuko accepted his role in the grand scheme of things, Mo informed him how every member of the group had been compromised. Zuko was furious when he found out that Malime met with an accident and Pakamile was kidnapped. He realized that the only way to stop Mtima was by exposing him, and he contacted Mike Bressler to hand over the files Johnny had left. They secretly met at a restaurant, and before handing over the documents, Zuko laid forth a condition: he was desperate to be reunited with his family, and he hoped for Bressler to help him.Bressler helped Zuko connect with Naledi, and it was from her that he found out about Malime's death. Zuko realized that before destroying Mtima, it was important that he get his son back. Naledi had been keeping track of Mo, and she had located a cabin she frequented. Bressler recognized the cabin; it was where Mtima lived when he visited Cape Town. Zuko broke into Mtima's cabin to seek his ultimate revenge.With the spear handed to him by his elders, Zuko slayed Mtima's guards one after the other. Mtima was easy to knock out, and by the time he came back to his senses, Zuko had his spear pressed on Mtima's throat. The presidential hopeful was well aware that Zuko was desperate to get his son back, and he knew that he would not be harmed as long as he had Pakamile. Zuko instructed Mo to get his son back, and in the meantime, Mtima tried to lure Zuko with money.Mtima's PIA agents arrived at the cabin, and what followed was an intense fight where Zuko triumphed. Mo brought along Pakamile to stop Zuko and force him to hand over the files. Zuko explained that he had already handed over the files for printing, and Mtima's political career was over. Mo was holding a gun, and she pointed it at Zuko. Mtima encouraged her to shoot him dead and prove to the world that she was not a traitor like her father. Mo crossed all boundaries, fearing being publicly shamed for her father's association with the apartheid regime, but she realized that as long as Mtima lived, there would never be an end to her misery.Mo shoots Mtima dead. She wanted to kill Zuko as well, but Naledi came to his rescue. Mo was shot dead, and it was all over for Mtima and his supporters.
The next morning, the murders of Daza Mtima and Molebogeng Kwena made it to the headlines. There were officially no suspects, suggesting that Zuko and Naledi had managed to walk away Scot-free. The files Johnny had gathered made it to the public, and those involved in the State capture were apprehended. While some sense of justice was brought into the world, Zuko headed back to his childhood home at the Great Fish River with his son by his side. He wanted to live a life of a recluse and dedicate all his time to farming, just like he and Pakamile had always planned.</p>

                            <p>Description: Oliwia (Anna Szymanczyk) worked as a chef in Wroclaw, and she was doing great in her career. For the last five years, her boss was dependent on her, and he knew that his cafe was so well known because of the exquisite dishes that Oliwia used to make.
One day, Oliwia got a call from her village, situated in the Podlaskie province, and she was informed that her grandmother had passed away. She asked her boss for a leave and rushed to her village immediately, as she knew that she was the only family member her grandmother had.
Oliwia's mother and grandmother used to fight all the time, and as a result, Oliwia never stayed a lot with her grandmother as her mother went off to live on the other side of the world.
Oliwia grew to up be a girl with a hot temper and no patience.Oliwia got the shock of her life when she realized that it was all an act, and her grandmother was pretty much alive. Her grandmother, Halina (Anna Seniuk), had lied to her, saying she wanted Oliwia to come back to the village and stay with her. Oliwia got mad at first, but then she realized that her grandmother missed her way too much. Oliwia's car was broken down (most probably it was messed up by one of the villagers to prompt Oliwia to stay the night).
Halina says that it was Oliwia's mother who turned her against her grandmother.
Still, Oliwia knew that she would go back in a couple of days, but she had no clue about what Halina had in her mind. She went missing just a day before Oliwia's departure, and she left a note for the latter, telling her that she was leaving her farm in her care. The farm had a horse named Dumpling which was bought for Oliwia when it was a colt.Oliwia was stuck, and additionally, she didn't know how to manage an entire farm. Luckily, she met a man who told her that he was Wojtek (Mateusz Janicki), the caretaker who generally provided a helping hand to Halina. Oliwia was glad that she found someone on whom she could put all the responsibilities and leave, but she had no clue that the entire village was conspiring together with Halina.
Oliwia meets her childhood friend Matylda Wasyl (Angelika Cegielska-Swiatek), and they used to go apple picking together. Matylda is with the local police and tells Oliwia that Halina is alive and well and is using the internet at Matylda's house to keep tabs on Oliwia.Eventually, Oliwia starts riding Dumpling and enjoying the farm life. Wojtek even fixes her car. Oliwia bonds with her farm animals when a recently born baby goat got sick and really weak. Oliwia had to feed the baby goat by herself to save her life.
The town had many colorful characters including 2 brothers who brewed their own moonshine. Oliwia suggests them to mix their flavors to create an even more amazing brew.Everybody knew that Halina was hiding in Jan's (Artur Barcis) house, but no one informed Oliwia about it, as they, too, wanted her to stay back with her grandmother. The man who said he was Wojtek was actually the owner of the Herbal World, and his real name was Kuba Wolak. Kuba made sure that Olivia's car didn't start the next day, hoping that it would coerce her to stay back.Although Oliwia was annoyed when her car didn't start, she decided to see the brighter side of things. She knew she had a hectic life in the city, and she realized that it wouldn't be such a bad thing to stay back and take some downtime. Halina was happy that her plan was working, and she wished and hoped that her granddaughter would stay there for good.
Oliwia gets a hang of farm work, including the milking of goats. Matylda comes by and convinces her to take a longer vacation from work. Her boss is distraught but gives her another week.Now, firstly, Kuba had lied about his identity, and secondly, Oliwia got to know that he was an arch-nemesis of her grandmother. Oliwia got to know that, first, Kuba and his father had filed a suit against her grandmother for the damages (to tune of 25,000 Zlotys) caused to their business.
Oliwia's mother had sold their meadow to Kuba's father, and this is what Halina and Oliwia's mother fought about, as the meadow was sold without Halina's consent.
Oliwia realizes that man she thought was Wojtek is really Kuba. She had gone with an offer to sell the entire farm for 150,000 Zoltys, but Kuba tells Oliwia that Halina can earn that money from the farm to pay of her debts.Oliwia realized that maybe Kuba was a monopolist, and he was envious of the fact that Halina's cheese production business was doing so well. Halina won awards every year for her product, and it was said that her cheese was the best in the entire region. This is when the health department had come for inspection at Halina's farm, and after that, they had put a ban on the production of cheese.Halina's cheese was of the best quality, and it felt like either the health inspector had a grudge against her, or somebody had bribed him or used their influence to destroy Halina's business. The suspicion fell on Kuba, as he was the one who had these legal battles going on. Kuba had fallen for Oliwia, and he wanted to tell her that he was not the person she believed him to be. Kuba tried telling Oliwia that it was all a big misunderstanding. He told her that he had not called the health department, and in fact, it was Halina who had filed a complaint against him at first.Kuba had separated from his wife sometime back, and his girl stayed with him. Kuba wanted things to work out between him and Oliwia, and so one day, on the advice of his daughter, he decided to express his feelings to her. Oliwia also liked Kuba, but the fact was that she was never going to stay in the village, and a long-distance relationship was something that she felt was not doable.
Kuba tried to approach Oliwia, but he was stopped by Halina's friends who did not want Oliwia mixing up with Halina's arch-nemesis.
Oliwia restarts making cheese from goat milk, using Halina's recipe. The first batch is only so-so. Kuba's daughter comes by and suggests that Oliwia can improve the taste using herbs from Kuba's herb garden. Oliwia becomes best friends with Kuba's daughter and learns that Kuba is in love with her.Over a period of time, Kuba realized that not only did he have a strong bond with Oliwia on a personal level, but they were also too good when it came to professional partnerships. One time, people from Warsaw were coming to meet Kuba as they saw potential in his herb world initiative, and they wanted to invest money in the new venture that he was going to open in Bialystok. At the last moment, Kuba realized that his father had fired the chef and there was nobody to cook food for them. He asked Oliwia to help him out, and considering she was a professional chef, she made the most delicious lunch for the guests. The Varsovians were impressed, and they decided to invest money in Kuba's venture.When Halina came back from hiding, she got to know that it was a lady named Maryla Jura (Beata Kawka) who had snitched and informed the health department.
Halina accepted Kuba and Oliwia's relationship, as she knew that there was a possibility that because of Kuba, Oliwia might stay back. But Oliwia was a practical girl, and she decided that her life was in the city. She had huge dreams, and so to fulfill them once again, with tears in her eyes, she went back.
Kuba stood there on his farm, watching Oliwia drive her car away. He wanted to stop her; he wanted to tell her how much he needed her in his life, but he knew that he couldn't do that. Kuba knew that their relationship wouldn't be sustainable if he forced her to stay. Kuba wanted her to get the realization, and he was prepared that probably she wouldn't ever return to the village.But something happened to Oliwia once she got back to her city. She felt a void inside her, and she just couldn't focus on anything.
Yes, her career was there, but there was nobody around her whom she could call her own. She craved her grandmother's presence; she longed to be with Kuba, and she felt deprived of that warmth that she got there from everybody else.That's when Oliwia decided to go back to her village. It was a tough decision for her, but she was very clear about her priorities. In the end, Kuba was elated when he found that Oliwia had come back, and he just couldn't stop blushing when he heard the hooves of her horse approaching him. Halina got what she wanted, and probably in the future, Oliwia wouldn't have to compromise on her career, and she would take her grandmother's home-grown business to greater heights.</p>

                            <p>Description: On July 11, 2021, Wembley Stadium was on the brink of a historic win for Gareth Southgate's England team. The squad had inspired the country on their journey to England's first major final since 1966, and the European Championship was within their reach. But as England supporters arrived at Wembley from all corners of the country, celebration quickly turned to chaos. Mayhem took over with scenes of drunkenness and drug-taking, and ticketless fans saw an opportunity to storm the stadium. With compelling first-hand testimony and visceral user-generated content, this is the dramatic story of a day that began with euphoria, and ended in a nation left reeling.</p>

                            <p>Description: For generations, bumblebees have roamed the earth, tirelessly pollinating our crops and wildflowers, and contributing to the biodiversity of our ecosystems. But with the changing climate and other threats, the survival of these beloved pollinators has been put in jeopardy. "Franklin's Bumblebee," a once-common species, is now critically endangered, with the last sighting dating back to 2006. Today, a group of scientists and explorers embark on a week-long mission every July to search for this elusive bumblebee, hoping to find it before it's too late. This documentary follows the journey of over 50 dedicated individuals as they search for Franklin's Bumblebee and discuss the four major threats to bumblebee populations worldwide: access to food, habitat loss, pesticide use, and disease. Through stunning cinematography and insightful interviews, we explore the vital role of bumblebees in our ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these important pollinators. Join us on this journey to uncover the fate of Franklin's Bumblebee and learn how we can help protect bumblebees and preserve the natural world we all share.—Janice Overbeck</p>

                            <p>Description: Set in the northern snowy landscapes of Sweden, Sami family prepares their young daughter for her earmark ceremony, which is an important tradition in their culture. The young girl, Elsa (Elin Kristina Oskal), is equally excited and scared of what she has to do, as she wants to feel one with her people but also does not want to hurt any of their animals.
As her father shows her the many calves she can choose from, Elsa picks up a beautiful baby reindeer with white fur and a mark on its head. She lovingly names it Nastegallu. In the weeks following the ceremony, Elsa and Nastegallu grow very close to each other, as the animal shows all signs of love and submission to her. Despite her father's warnings, little Elsa also showers the reindeer with grass and other treats. Elsa is a natural reindeer herder.
Lasse (Pvva Pittja) is Elsa's brother and Nils-Johan (Magnus Kuhmunen) is her father.But the occupation has been growing increasingly tough for the Sami people because people of other ethnicity and cultures living in the nearby areas do not respect the animals at all. In fact, a group of hunters has been killing the reindeer. Tragedy strikes for Elsa when she suddenly sees a man kill Nastegallu with a knife attack at the reindeer grazing grounds, but she has to hide in fear. The killer sees Elsa and threatens to kill her, too, if she ever speaks up about it.
By the time the girl's father, uncle, and brother reach the scene, it is too late to catch the killer. The next day, Elsa's father takes her to the nearest police station to file a complaint against the perpetrator, and incidentally, she sees the same man at the place, having a friendly chat with the officers. Shocked and scared for her own safety, Elsa does not say anything about seeing the killer in action to the police officer . The police officially report Nastegallu as having been stolen, as they refuse to accept charges of slaughter.Ten years pass by, and Elsa is now a young adult, having taken on the role of a teacher at the local school. She is as loving and protective of her culture and identity as a Sami woman, and so she is still threatened by the constant butchering of reindeer, which is still not investigated or punished. To this day, Elsa regrets not speaking up about the perpetrator despite having recognized him as their neighbor, Robert Isaksson (Martin Wallstrom). As the woman intends to somehow punish the man for his crimes, more troubling situations are posed against the Sami people.
Niila (Niila Emanuel Omma) is the son of the Reindeer King and is interested in Elsa.Sami people are entirely dependent on the herds of reindeer that they own, as their whole life is driven by the animals. As they rear the animals for skin, fur, and meat and also rely on these products as a means of trade, the indigenous people would be very clueless without the existence of the reindeer. Moreover, the practice of herding reindeer and the associated activities with it are all part of the Sami's culture, which is severely endangered at this point in time. Due to climate changes and deforestation, it is increasingly difficult to sustain the herds. Lasse even took up a job at the mines in town of Kiruna.For people of other cultures living in the nearby regions, the reindeer is nothing more than a hassle, for they are forced to shape their lives according to the animals' needs. Because of the close connection between the creatures and the Sami people, which are officially declared endangered, the government has also made certain rules to help both sets survive better. As a result, the others in the area have to abide by laws, such as not being able to use snowmobiles during certain seasons and having to stay clear of the paths used by the reindeer during their migration from summer to winter pastures. With no concern for the animals or the Sami people, the likes of Robert Isaksson keep harping about how their lives are being affected by the animals and the rules surrounding their conservation in an attempt to get rid of them.As a result, the feeling of xenophobia is greatly on the rise among these communities, as they genuinely disrespect the Sami people, their culture, and their way of life. To make matters worse, most of the officials in the police and administration, if not all, are Swedish or Caucasians, meaning that they, too, are not bothered by the killings of the reindeer and the overall discrimination that the Sami face.Robert Isaksson takes the most daring and vile step of killing the reindeer in order to both run a business and also disrespect the Sami in the region. Robert runs an illegal reindeer hunting and meat trade, because of which he shoots down and kills numerous animals, but he is also not like any usual hunter. The man is boastful and brash with his killings, sometimes torturing and teasing the animals, even injuring and killing one with his snowmobile in one instance. He is egoistic as well, which leads to extreme anger and frustration in him often, especially with regards to the Sami people having a say in how things in the region should operate. Robert and his men kill multiple animals and make a crude altar out of the dead bodies, mocking the Sami people and their way of life. They also put the reindeer fodder on fire, destroying expensive supplies while even making a video of it and ridiculing the owners.One day Elsa followed the snowmobile tracks after she heard shots. And she reached a shed that belonged to Robert. Else calls the police, but they don't have a warrant to enter Robert's property. Robert claims that the Sami tribes are killing their own reindeer and claiming theft compensation from the Government.Along with the external problems that the group has to face, Elsa is also bitter and disgruntled with the reactions of the very people in her tribe, as they are too soft and ineffective in protecting their rights. The elected leader of the Sami in the region, Olle (Simon Issat Marainen), is clearly not stern enough in his negotiations, and he is also rather sexist, as he does not want a woman, especially a young one like Elsa, to be so vocal about their problems. Elsa is understandably frustrated by this situation, and she even seriously considers leaving the village to pursue higher education as she starts to feel that there is no way forward for her people.The village council soon has a meeting with representatives of all the families living in the area as the matter of a mining business being opened is discussed. The Sami people naturally object to it, as the existence of a large mine in the middle of the route used by their reindeer would cause trouble for the animals. Moreover, the mine would also pollute the water and air, along with the land, which would very quickly give rise to other environmental degradation. However, the others in the area complain that their benefits should also be considered at times. With laws against hunting and fishing, the mine would be the only major opportunity for employment in the village, which is highly required for the livelihood of these people. In this meeting, Elsa's frustration boils over, and she directly addresses the committee, speaking about the importance of the reindeer for her people.
Lasse is depressed at working over in the mines and commits suicide. On the day of his funeral, Elsa runs into Robert and warns him to stop killing the reindeer.
Later that day, the family attends a traditional Sami fair, and Elsa has sex with Niila.A false narrative, that the Sami people themselves kill their reindeer in order to get government compensation, is being floated around, and Elsa is terribly angered by it. She decides to speak out and give a whole interview to one of the news channels, which is published in the next day's newspaper. This further shocks Olle, and he finally bars Elsa from attending meetings.Elsa starts to speak up against the vile nature of Robert and his followers and even regularly reports the killings to the police, Isaksson is furious and wants his revenge. Sometime later, when Robert Isaksson kills multiple reindeer and makes a mocking altar out of their skulls by the side of the highway, news TV channels from the nearby towns report on the incident.
One day Elsa and Niila finds Robert driving a snowmobile through their protected reindeer pastures. Niila confronts Robert, but is assaulted by Robert with Niila's own gun.In a drunken state, he goes over to Elsa's house to threaten her. He breaks into the house on the very night that Elsa's parents are away, and her brother is drunk. He chases her down only because he did not like her tone when she had threatened him the previous day. It is only because Elsa cleverly manages to hide in the basement and also inform the police about the intruder in her house that she survives the night.Elsa sneaks into Robert's warehouse and photographs everything she sees inside it as proof of the illegal meat trade that was going on. Robert had security cameras installed all over the place, and as soon as he monitors an intrusion on his property, he returns to the place. A tense chase follows, with Robert surely intending to kill Elsa if he can get his hands on her.However, the whole situation changes as Robert loses control of his snowmobile and lands on top of a defrosting water body. The heavy weight and impact of the crash make the ice break, and the man falls into the freezing cold water. With his leg already injured by the crash, Robert is unable to swim up and immediately drowns and dies.Despite her anger against the man, Elsa had finally decided to help him, even throwing a rope towards him, but she was unable to save him. A police investigation into the matter soon led to the arrest of other men who had been part of the meat trade.Else moves on with her life and teaches her culture to other members of the tribe, including the process of cutting off the reindeer's ear tip, suggesting that she continues to spread her culture through generations after having protected her people from the vile Robert Isaksson.</p>

He now starts a new life in Hokkaido. To raise money for his plan, he pans for gold in Hokkaido. He hears about the existence of gold nuggets that belonged to the indigenous Ainu people, but were stolen by a man known as Noppera-bo. Right before he was caught, Noppera-bo allegedly hid the gold nuggets. In prison, Noppera-bo tattooed the secret location among the bodies of 24 different prisoners. Each prisoner had a piece that would collectively reveal the location of the gold nuggets. Noppera-bo then escaped prison with those 24 prisoners. One day, Saichi Sugimoto is attacked by a wild bear. At that time, he is saved by an Ainu girl named Asirpa (Anna Yamada). Asirpa's father was killed by the man who stole the gold nuggets and she wants to take revenge on her father's killer. Saichi Sugimoto and Asirpa, for different reasons, begin to work together. More people join the chase for the hidden gold nuggets.—AsianWiki</p>

                            <p>Description: Meg Tompkins put aside her burgeoning real estate career in Boston to take over her mother's book store, Mimi's Book Corner, in Nantucket when Mimi became ill. With Mimi now having passed several years ago, Meg has an absent silent partner in her Aunt Renee solely to help Meg out financially. Meg has to decide what to do when she learns that Aunt Renee, in wanting a new phase in life in retirement, wants to sell her interest in the store, Meg uncertain if she either can or wants to take on the financial burden on her own especially as the store fell into her lap rather than she ever having pursued it. One of Meg's recent initiatives at the store is what she calls "Blind Date with a Book Club" where she, in wanting to promote the work of unknown authors, being local so much the better, sells books she curates with only a short tag line describing the book, with nothing else about the book known to the buyer, they to return the following week to discuss the book in a book club setting. NPR radio host Raina Breem interviews Meg about the book club, Raina's interest primarily in real blind dates between club members. While unintentional, Meg does realize that the club can bring together people in a romantic sense in their connection to the books. One person who hears the interview is Graham Sterling, a best selling author of a YA series, he currently struggling on writing book eight of the series, the second to last in his current contract, in he instead wanting to write his great American novel. He has completed a historical romance as such, the manuscript which his publisher does not want to publish both in it being off his brand and they considering it good but not great. As such, Graham decides to self-publish it under the pseudonym Dylan Turner and wants Meg to curate it for the book club to get an untainted opinion by real readers. In meeting "Dylan", Meg ultimately learns his true identity and decides to include it for the book club to help him out despite she having the same opinion of the book as his publishers.

                            <p>Description: Children's book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Alice enjoys Jessica but Taylor keeps her at arms length. Jessica is plagued by nightmares which include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear in the basement named Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor named Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, reunites with her. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember.Alice and Taylor's mentally disturbed biological mother Samantha sneaks into the house to see her daughters and attacks Jessica. When the police arrive to arrest Samantha, Taylor confesses to texting her. Jessica then puts Alice and Chauncey to bed, and remarks that she had a similar childhood friend.Max leaves to embark on tour and Alice becomes hyper-focused on a scavenger hunt she claims was given to her by Chauncey. Chauncey's overwhelming presence in Alice's life begins to disturb Jessica. One day when Jessica leaves to visit Ben, Taylor invites an acquaintance over, Liam. Liam grabs a bottle of liquor which he accidentally shatters. He attempts to find a towel before being toyed with by Chauncey, who briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica arrives back home, angering Taylor.Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail prompting her to call a child psychologist named Dr. Soto. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey while also speaking on his behalf. Chauncey makes threatening remarks towards Jessica and Alice sobs over their crumbling friendship. Jessica later discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto then shows Jessica footage of a past patient who uses the same phrase as Alice: "Never Ever". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey which Taylor blames her stepmother for.Taylor meets Gloria, who tells her that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains to Taylor that imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned, which Jessica did with Chauncey. At home, Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and of the Never Ever. All three women complete the scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm to appear.In the Never Ever realm, the group find a door showing Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, Jessica was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but he became mad in the process after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Afterwards, Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm throughout her life. Gloria is savagely mauled by Chauncey when a door opens beside her. Jessica and Taylor rush off, searching for Alice. Both find Alice and attempt to escape while Chauncey pursues behind them. Jessica is able to stop Chauncey by stabbing him in the eye with scissors.After reuniting with Ben and Max at Ben's institution, Jessica realizes she is still stuck in the Never Ever. Chauncey used Alice as bait to get to Jessica and seeks revenge for her prior abandonment. Taylor arrives and saves Jessica. Chauncey turns to his true form akin to Simon. The spider tries to turn Jessica and Taylor insane with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire and seals him behind the door. The family escapes as the house burns to the ground.The family check into a hotel but are frightened by a child playing with his teddy bear who resembles Chauncey. The three leave to another hotel for their safety.</p>

                            <p>Description: A single Ukrainian infantry company find themselves in a life or death battle to defend the eastern front against intense Russian attacks. This is an extraordinary portrait of lives compromised by the turmoil of a bloody war, filmed by Ukrainian soldiers. With exclusive access to a tightly controlled front line, the film follows the mission of a special battalion as they undertake a single deployment on one of Ukraine's most violent battlefronts, a snow-covered forest near Kupyansk. Their mission is to defend a railway line, a key strategic asset that, if captured, will enable Russia to mount a direct attack on Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv.—BBC TWO</p>

                            <p>Description: In 2018, one of the most shocking crimes in recent Argentine history occurred. Nahir Galarza, a 19-year-old woman, was accused and convicted of murdering her boyfriend, Fernando Pastorizzo, thus becoming the youngest woman in the country's history to be sentenced to life imprisonment for her crimes. However, the story takes a significant turn when Nahir completely changes her version, shifting the accusation to her father, an officer of the Argentine police, claiming he was the real killer. An accusation that the local justice system did not take seriously.</p>

He now starts a new life in Hokkaido. To raise money for his plan, he pans for gold in Hokkaido. He hears about the existence of gold nuggets that belonged to the indigenous Ainu people, but were stolen by a man known as Noppera-bo. Right before he was caught, Noppera-bo allegedly hid the gold nuggets. In prison, Noppera-bo tattooed the secret location among the bodies of 24 different prisoners. Each prisoner had a piece that would collectively reveal the location of the gold nuggets. Noppera-bo then escaped prison with those 24 prisoners. One day, Saichi Sugimoto is attacked by a wild bear. At that time, he is saved by an Ainu girl named Asirpa (Anna Yamada). Asirpa's father was killed by the man who stole the gold nuggets and she wants to take revenge on her father's killer. Saichi Sugimoto and Asirpa, for different reasons, begin to work together. More people join the chase for the hidden gold nuggets.—AsianWiki</p>

Rudy's Brazilian mother Maria (Maria Mancuso) doesn't like the white girl anyway, and so when she hears that Haley has broken up with Rudy, she thinks it's the perfect opportunity to introduce him to women of his own heritage, the beautiful Brazilians.
Rudy hears music in everything; it's almost like a form of therapy for him, and his escape from the real world. When he walks down the subway steps, it's a piano. When he sits in a diner with his girlfriend, he can't help but be distracted by the music of cooking and serving. This is exactly why Haley doesn't feel like he cares for her at all.
Additionally, he's always dividing his attention between her and his mother, so she feels unseen.Rudy is in his last year of school, and his only interests are puppets and music, something Haley doesn't understand. She wants him to become more serious in life and get a real job when they live together at university (which happens in 6 weeks). Rudy spends most of his time working on these "hobbies" and works late into the morning down in the subway for some petty cash, which doesn't really help his cause. Haley and Rudy have been together for 4 years. Rudy does puppet shows in the subway and is working on his music thesis. But Haley doesn't believe that Rudy has made enough progress.Plus, he lives at home with his mother. But at least that means he always has a lot of food on his plate. Being broken up makes Rudy realize he should take things a bit seriously. He tries to study hard, but it doesn't really work. Maria sets Rudy up with a nice Brazilian girl named Luana (Camila Senna), which is really embarrassing for him. Luana is really aggressive in her approach, but Rudy pushes her back. This prompts Luana to walk away, telling Maria that Rudy needs help.
His mother sends him to buy fish one day, and there, like the feeling of spring after a cold winter, he sees Isabella (Camila Mendes), a Brazilian. Isabella woks at the fish market and gaping at her Rudy is hit in the face with a fish.Rudy returns to the store later and walks Isabella to a market fair that she was planning on visiting. Isabella is very different from Haley. She's actually interested in seeing the world through Rudy's eyes. Rudy shows how he can turn everyday regular sounds into a rhythm.
Isabella suggests Rudy take his show "up" and actually work on it. In the meantime, at school, Haley notices him trying to ask questions in class (it's only because it's about music). Haley tells Rudy that she wants to give another shot to their relationship.Now Rudy is stuck between his ex of four years, who wants to make things work out, and a fresh perspective, who is more understanding of him because of their matching backgrounds. Isabella tells him how her mother abandoned her when she was 15, and she went back to Brazil for a man. Rudy spends a lot of time chit-chatting with his puppet about Isabella.Anwar (J.B. Smoove) is Rudy's friend and runs a fast-food truck. Rudy confides in Anwar that at this point he finds both Isabella and Haley equally alluring. Anwar asks him to pursue both, while his puppet advises strongly against it.One night, when he's trying to take Isabella out on a date using his friend's truck, he ends up getting shot in the arm. It's only grazing, but this gets Isabella and Rudy closer. They share a kiss and admit that they both feel connected to each other. She covers Rudy's ears when he goes to his faraway place and calms him down.Still, somehow, Rudy ends up two-timing the two girls "by accident". While things are going wonderfully with Isabella, he ends up going to Haley's house for a meal, which goes terribly. Her parents (Bruce (Gregory Jones) and Claire (Regina Schneider)) are racist and don't see how he's right for their daughter.
Rudy asks to meet Haley at a Brazilian restaurant in his part of town to break up with her. Isabella happens to be in the same restaurant getting takeout. Somehow, this doesn't knock some sense into Rudy, and he ends up trying to divide his time between the two girls.
In the end, his mother shows up, and the three women surround him in the middle of the restaurant. Rudy, who explodes finally, revealing to Haley that he invited her there to break up with her because he found "another woman." Unfortunately, Isabella doesn't care if she's the chosen one; she leaves the restaurant.After a drunken night makes Rudy hallucinate that his life is a routine mess, his mother tries to knock some sense into Rudy. She asks him what he wants in life, and he lists a few things. One is to be happy; the other is to spend time with his mother, his puppets and music, and ultimately Isabella. She's kind of his savior, or that's what the dream made it seem like.
Rudy writes a song for Isabella to apologize, but she asks him to speak to her like a real adult. She tells him that he's trying hard to keep something together that he doesn't even know if he really wants. His apology doesn't work because Isabella has always been left with her feelings ignored.It's time for Rudy to submit his thesis, but instead, he turns it into a script titled "Musica," inspired by his own life. Finally, Rudy takes his show above ground and presents a comedy show with his puppets recreating scenes from his life with music and laughter.
Ultimately, after his show is a success, he receives takeout with a smiley face on the cover. This is the same smiley face Isabella drew for him after he got smacked by a piece of fish in the face.</p>

                            <p>Description: Children's book author Jessica is married to musician Max. Max has two daughters from his first marriage: younger daughter Alice, and teenager Taylor. Alice enjoys Jessica but Taylor keeps her at arms length. Jessica is plagued by nightmares which include her mentally-ill father Ben and a fictional character from her books, Simon the spider. When the family moves into Jessica's childhood home, Alice discovers a teddy bear in the basement named Chauncey and quickly forms a bond with him. An elderly neighbor named Gloria, who babysat Jessica when she was a child, reunites with her. Gloria shares memories of Jessica's childhood, which she cannot remember.Alice and Taylor's mentally disturbed biological mother Samantha sneaks into the house to see her daughters and attacks Jessica. When the police arrive to arrest Samantha, Taylor confesses to texting her. Jessica then puts Alice and Chauncey to bed, and remarks that she had a similar childhood friend.Max leaves to embark on tour and Alice becomes hyper-focused on a scavenger hunt she claims was given to her by Chauncey. Chauncey's overwhelming presence in Alice's life begins to disturb Jessica. One day when Jessica leaves to visit Ben, Taylor invites an acquaintance over, Liam. Liam grabs a bottle of liquor which he accidentally shatters. He attempts to find a towel before being toyed with by Chauncey, who briefly turns into a monstrous bear. Jessica arrives back home, angering Taylor.Jessica narrowly stops Alice from slamming her hand down onto a nail prompting her to call a child psychologist named Dr. Soto. Soto observes Alice talk to Chauncey while also speaking on his behalf. Chauncey makes threatening remarks towards Jessica and Alice sobs over their crumbling friendship. Jessica later discovers that only she and Alice can see the stuffed bear. Soto then shows Jessica footage of a past patient who uses the same phrase as Alice: "Never Ever". Alice disappears after speaking to Chauncey which Taylor blames her stepmother for.Taylor meets Gloria, who tells her that Chauncey was also Jessica's childhood imaginary friend. Gloria explains to Taylor that imaginary friends are spirits who tether to the young and can become sinister if abandoned, which Jessica did with Chauncey. At home, Jessica goes through her old belongings and finds drawings of Chauncey and of the Never Ever. All three women complete the scavenger hunt together, resulting in a glowing door leading to the Never Ever realm to appear.In the Never Ever realm, the group find a door showing Jessica's repressed memories. As a child, Jessica was lured by Chauncey into the Never Ever. Ben had rescued her, but he became mad in the process after seeing Chauncey's eyes. Afterwards, Jessica was sent to live with her grandparents. Gloria closes the escape route, having become obsessed with the realm throughout her life. Gloria is savagely mauled by Chauncey when a door opens beside her. Jessica and Taylor rush off, searching for Alice. Both find Alice and attempt to escape while Chauncey pursues behind them. Jessica is able to stop Chauncey by stabbing him in the eye with scissors.After reuniting with Ben and Max at Ben's institution, Jessica realizes she is still stuck in the Never Ever. Chauncey used Alice as bait to get to Jessica and seeks revenge for her prior abandonment. Taylor arrives and saves Jessica. Chauncey turns to his true form akin to Simon. The spider tries to turn Jessica and Taylor insane with his eyes, but Alice sets the creature on fire and seals him behind the door. The family escapes as the house burns to the ground.The family check into a hotel but are frightened by a child playing with his teddy bear who resembles Chauncey. The three leave to another hotel for their safety.</p>

                            <p>Description: One cold, stormy night in New York City, a mysterious object falls from the sky and smashes through the window of a rundown apartment building. It is an egg, and from this egg emerges a strange little spider... The creature is discovered by Charlotte, a rebellious 12-year-old girl obsessed with comic books. Despite her stepfather Ethan's best efforts to connect with her through their comic book co-creation Fang Girl, Charlotte feels isolated. Her mother and Ethan are distracted by their new baby and are struggling to cope, leaving Charlotte to bond with the spider. Keeping it as a secret pet, she names it Sting. As Charlotte's fascination with Sting increases, so does its size. Growing at a monstrous rate, Sting's appetite for blood becomes insatiable. Neighbours' pets start to go missing, and then the neighbours themselves. Soon Charlotte's family and the eccentric characters of the building realise that they are all trapped, hunted by a ravenous supersized arachnid with a taste for human flesh - and Charlotte is the only one who knows how to stop it.</p>

Despite Taylor's lack of experience, God convinces him to do the impossible: write a hit movie using his dysfunctional, crazy family as the inspiration. But the Devil (Mickey Rourke) is in the details and he has his own fiendish plan to disrupt the whole deal.—Briarcliff Entertainment</p>

Twenty years after creating this "friend", Dean, JT, and Wes (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler) still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior. When their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet the fabled Mr. Stanicky, the guilty trio decide to hire washed-up actor and raunchy celebrity impersonator "Rock Hard" Rod (John Cena) to bring him to life. But when Rod takes his role of a lifetime too far, they begin to wish they'd never invented Ricky in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: "Horizon" embarks on a vivid exploration of Earth's diverse ecosystems, starting with the rich marine life beneath the seas and moving through the vital mangroves, showcasing the interconnectedness of these habitats. The journey begins with a dive into the ocean's depths to admire its fauna and seabeds, then transitions to the mangroves where the importance of these ecosystems is highlighted through the lives of pelicans on Farasan Island and flamingos, emphasizing conservation efforts like waste cleaning and reforestation. The narrative then shifts from the serene beauty of the Farasan Islands at sunset to the harsh desert landscape, home to gazelles, ostriches, and bustards, all part of a crucial reintroduction project. The film climbs into the mountains to reveal vultures, ibex, and monkeys, culminating with the Arabian leopard's struggle for survival and reintroduction efforts. The documentary concludes at King Abdullah's University for Science and Technology, where innovative 3D scanning techniques are used to preserve coral reefs, encapsulating the film's overarching theme of the critical need for preservation and reintroduction across the planet's varied ecosystems.—Forward Films (SA)</p>

                            <p>Description: Specializing in the works of Jane Austen, Dr. Eloise Cavendish is the keynote speaker at this year's Jane Austen League of America (JALA) conference and ball. This annual event is only the second time she's ever attended as, as an academic through and through, she doesn't much like the "ball" component, with many attendees treating JALA like one big Regency costume party. She doesn't even really see Austen, as most do, as a romance novelist in her rather clinical perspective. In addition to being able to visit with Mia Cavendish, her drama queen of a sister at the same time in Mia living in town, Eloise primarily accepted the invitation to meet and impress Dr. Victoria Jennings, one of the event organizers who is part of the hiring committee for a job at Princeton, a job Eloise would very much like. Unlike most, single Eloise is dismayed literally to meet "Mr. Darcy", he really Sam Lee, someone hired to dress and act like Mr. Darcy to provide some color to JALA. Her dismay is that Sam is doing double duty as her special guest liaison to JALA, including immersing her into what is somewhat expected of her in the "costume party" aspect. Eloise hates to admit that she needs Sam's help to impress Dr. Jennings, while she in turn helps him with a somewhat personal matter also associated to Dr. Jennings. The question becomes whether Eloise and Sam can bridge their differences in helping each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Mindwash follows the story of Billy Seldom (Ben Edlin), a motivational speaker who is on the verge of becoming a household name with the slogan, "Think for Yourself." He is about to reach a new pinnacle of success when the world suffers a catastrophic event. We follow him on a journey of self-destruction, including being on the verge of a cryptic demise of a co-dependent relationship with his longtime girlfriend Natalie (Camille Hyde), as he wrestles with the ever-changing landscape of media, fear, and influence. Billy tries to find his place in a world now spiraling out of control and exemplifying the lack of individual thinking. Billy must now ask himself if he really thinks for himself.</p>

                            <p>Description: "Horizon" embarks on a vivid exploration of Earth's diverse ecosystems, starting with the rich marine life beneath the seas and moving through the vital mangroves, showcasing the interconnectedness of these habitats. The journey begins with a dive into the ocean's depths to admire its fauna and seabeds, then transitions to the mangroves where the importance of these ecosystems is highlighted through the lives of pelicans on Farasan Island and flamingos, emphasizing conservation efforts like waste cleaning and reforestation. The narrative then shifts from the serene beauty of the Farasan Islands at sunset to the harsh desert landscape, home to gazelles, ostriches, and bustards, all part of a crucial reintroduction project. The film climbs into the mountains to reveal vultures, ibex, and monkeys, culminating with the Arabian leopard's struggle for survival and reintroduction efforts. The documentary concludes at King Abdullah's University for Science and Technology, where innovative 3D scanning techniques are used to preserve coral reefs, encapsulating the film's overarching theme of the critical need for preservation and reintroduction across the planet's varied ecosystems.—Forward Films (SA)</p>

                            <p>Description: Thirty-something Betty Baldwin is risk averse not solely in being an actuary and risk analyst, but specifically in matters of the heart because she believes a curse was placed on her when she was a teenager twenty years ago bringing harm to any boyfriend. The spirit of this curse seems to have rubbed off somewhat on her longtime best friend Mya who is facing one disaster after another in her wedding preparations to her fiancé Raul. With Betty, she has a history of pulling away from any boyfriend on the slightest hint of any harm coming to him. Betty believes the stars already have it in for her when she is attracted to her new neighbor Alex in he going into the world's danger zones as a photojournalist. Beyond his job, Alex is a risk taker in wanting to live life to the fullest. As they spend more time together, Betty has to decide what to do in really liking him but not wanting to see any harm come to him.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: The Hazelton Festival of Arts has gone through a few rough years, but Gabby, who is given the assignment to manage it this year by her boss Katrina, thinks that her novel idea of having acts of a professional paired with a local, amateur or professional, will give the show the needed kick-start to get it back on track. One of the acts she has already arranged is an aerial performance on the silks by her professional brother, Bennett, a former Olympic gymnast turned aerialist with an artistic circus troupe, his partner to be his regular partner Elise who qualifies as that local as living in Hazelton when they're not on the road. But when Bennett arrives back in town and announces that Elise has dropped out due to other commitments, Gabby is determined to find a local replacement, otherwise the act has to be dropped, the former option which doesn't sit well with Bennett who doesn't want to train someone else on such short notice. With the auditions having gone terribly, Gabby believes her friend Luna would be the perfect person. Luna, who came back to town to work for her family's construction company which was awarded the contract of any necessary construction work for the festival, is a former dancer, dancing which she doesn't like to let known still being her passion. As Bennett and Luna start working together, they butt heads in Bennett's doubts that they can put together a routine acceptable to him. But as they find the passion in their work, they become more confident that they can do more than a credible job as that passion transfers into their personal relationship. The question then becomes if there is a future for them as Bennett soon has to return to his regular work on the road.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Orion seems a lot like your average elementary school kid shy, unassuming, harboring a secret crush. But underneath his seemingly normal exterior, Orion is a ball of adolescent anxiety, completely consumed by irrational fears of bees, dogs, the ocean, cell phone waves, murderous gutter clowns, and even falling off of a cliff. But of all his fears, the thing he's the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grows closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.</p>

He is about to reach a new pinnacle of success when the world suffers a catastrophic event. We follow him on a journey of self-destruction, including being on the verge of a cryptic demise of a co-dependent relationship with his longtime girlfriend Natalie (Camille Hyde), as he wrestles with the ever-changing landscape of media, fear, and influence. Billy tries to find his place in a world now spiraling out of control and exemplifying the lack of individual thinking. Billy must now ask himself if he really thinks for himself.</p>

                            <p>Description: Specializing in the works of Jane Austen, Dr. Eloise Cavendish is the keynote speaker at this year's Jane Austen League of America (JALA) conference and ball. This annual event is only the second time she's ever attended as, as an academic through and through, she doesn't much like the "ball" component, with many attendees treating JALA like one big Regency costume party. She doesn't even really see Austen, as most do, as a romance novelist in her rather clinical perspective. In addition to being able to visit with Mia Cavendish, her drama queen of a sister at the same time in Mia living in town, Eloise primarily accepted the invitation to meet and impress Dr. Victoria Jennings, one of the event organizers who is part of the hiring committee for a job at Princeton, a job Eloise would very much like. Unlike most, single Eloise is dismayed literally to meet "Mr. Darcy", he really Sam Lee, someone hired to dress and act like Mr. Darcy to provide some color to JALA. Her dismay is that Sam is doing double duty as her special guest liaison to JALA, including immersing her into what is somewhat expected of her in the "costume party" aspect. Eloise hates to admit that she needs Sam's help to impress Dr. Jennings, while she in turn helps him with a somewhat personal matter also associated to Dr. Jennings. The question becomes whether Eloise and Sam can bridge their differences in helping each other.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial "Mr. Darcy", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Year: 2024</p>
                            <p>Language: pl</p>
                            <p>Description: Piotr (Mateusz Banasiuk) and Natalia (Weronika Ksiazkiewicz) used to be lovers with an intense passion for each other. Piotr professes his love for his girlfriend and proposes marriage to her, which Natalia readily agrees to with extreme joy.
Five years from that day, in the present time, the couple does not show the same intensity of love, and the feelings seem to have fizzled out. As they celebrate their anniversary at an inexpensive food court, Natalia is evidently upset with her husband for having such an ordinary celebration, and that too by paying for the food with free coupons. Piotr, on the other hand, expects praise for merely remembering the date and showing up for lunch. His gifts for his wife of five years are equally bad-a bouquet of flowers and an ironing press.Natalia's best friend, Agata (Agnieszka Wiedlocha), is also her colleague at the advertising company where she works, and both are disgruntled at the misogynistic remarks and the clearly sexist prejudice that they have to face at the place. Despite Natalia's brilliant professional performances repeatedly, she is never given any serious campaigns to work on.
Piotr's workplace environment is much better, though, as he is a senior representative at an insurance company. The only problem for him is that his current boss, a woman named Dagmara (Paulina Galazka), also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, and she is often indirectly flirtatious with him. The company is facing a financial crisis (due a celebrity client passing away and her young husband cashing in a $2.5 million insurance policy) and has canceled an important bonus that Piotr had been looking forward to. Dagmara promises to help him out, and she makes him a part of a new project she has been planning. The project is nicknamed "my baby" and is a nickname for a new product for safe vacation insurance. Piotr's good-for-nothing best friend, Lukasz (Piotr Rogucki), hangs around the office, trying to impress Dagmara without any effect.During their anniversary celebrations at the shopping mall, a woman sold Piotr a ticket to the Golden Rhinoceros lottery, and to their astonishment, the couple won the entire prize money, a million dollars. Piotr and Natalia are confident that their lives are going to turn around with this win.After winning the lottery, Piotr and Natalia are understandably delighted by their sudden fortune, but their very first ideas about how to spend it are quite different. Natalia is bitter at the fact that they have almost never taken any lavish vacation together, and she is all the more upset at seeing their neighbor Bogdan (Miroslaw Baka) and his wife go on foreign trips very frequently. Therefore, she wants to have a vacation to begin with, and then she also wants to invest the money in starting her own coffee shop, which has been a dream for a very long time.
Piotr is someone who always invests in safe bets, and his calculated spending habit is considered to be a miserly practice by his wife. The husband wants to buy a new house with the money. Natalia does not care about such matters, and she even resigns from her job and rents out the property where she wants to start her cafe.Piotr and Natalia have their own plans with the money, which makes it necessary for it to be divided, and Natalia deserves to get more because she paid most of the money while buying the ticket. However, such a split is not really possible unless they end their marriage, and for the time being, Piotr decides to withdraw the entire amount in cash and store it at their house. This arrangement is also out of insecurity, for there will be very visual evidence of who was taking how much from the stash and spending it away.Agata and Lukasz, poison the ears of their respective best friends against each other. Both suggest to their friends that their spouses will soon try to cheat them of the money and get it all for themselves since their marriage is not working out.
As a result, Natalia starts to believe that her husband is trying to kill her to take the entire million dollars and start a new life with his boss and ex-girlfriend, Dagmara. Agata even records a conversation between Piotr and Dagmara to prove her point. Dagmara had earlier gifted Piotr a new insurance policy in the name of Natalia, but when the wife sees this document, she believes it to be concrete proof of Piotr planning to kill her.
On the other hand, Piotr overhears conversations between his wife and her friend and misunderstands that they are trying to hatch a plan to get rid of him. Their individual pretensions of making acts of love also do not work, as Natalia is scared to drink any wine, believing it might be poisoned, since Piotr does not drink. Piotr is shocked to see Natalia sleep with a knife, which she keeps to defend herself, thinking that she intends to kill him with it.The new project that Dagmara had been working on was regarding travel insurance, and she managed to secure a deal with a resort in an idyllic Polish town. As part of his work, Piotr is given a chance to go up to this resort and spend a weekend there, and Lukasz immediately suggests that he should take Natalia as well, so that her exact plans will be exposed.
Natalia is slightly impressed by this sudden vacation plan, which she thinks is a genuine effort by her husband, and the two finally drive towards the resort. On the way, both jokingly ask whether the other is trying to kill them. Natalia drives the car, fearing that Piotr might kill her otherwise, and in the process, she crashes the car, making her husband make such a joke. Piotr accidentally launches their suitcase at Natalia, making her repeat the same joke. The couple checked in at the resort, with Piotr upgrading the voucher to the all-inclusive suite.Agata and Lukasz also come down to the town, even though they are staying at a different hotel, at the expense of their friends. They are the ones who make foolish and outlandish plans to kill the spouses of their friends. During a mountain climbing activity, which is also a bond-strengthening exercise for couples, Natalia is climbing and Piotr is her safety anchor point on the ground. Lukasz creates a distraction for Piotr, leading to Natalia falling and further believing that he is trying to kill her. Later on, Lukasz comes up with a plan for getting rid of the woman. He tells Piotr to take Natalia out on a date that night and get her terribly drunk. During this while, he would break into the couple's suit and leave soap all over the bathroom floor, so that she would slip and fall in her drunk state, and that would surely kill her.Agata also makes a plan to get Piotr killed, and her choice of weapon is almonds, for the man is allergic to the nuts. She tells Natalia to order garlic pasta during their date, as garlic looks very close to almonds, and she would flirt with the chef and replace garlic with almonds. Therefore, when Piotr would have it, he would have a fatal reaction, and nobody would suspect any foul play. This assassination attempt falls terribly because Agata cannot successfully make the switch, for the chef turns out to be an elderly woman, and so Piotr casually eats all the garlic. He does choke and gets into a difficult situation, but Natalia jumps in, ready to save him with his EpiPen. Later at night, when Natalia is about to enter the bathroom at their suite, Piotr also has a sudden change of mind, and he takes the literal fall for her.Piotr noticed how Natalia jumped in to inject the EpiPen, and Natalia saw how he stopped her from slipping and falling. But both are still misled by their respective friends, and when they are at the sauna together the next day, another tragedy strikes. This time around, Lukasz had planned to tamper with the sauna temperature, telling Piotr to make an excuse and leave the place at the last minute. Agata had planned to place a faulty rope during Piotr's skydiving session so that he would fall to his death.However, Piotr had asked Lukasz not to carry through the plan, as he no longer wanted to hurt his wife, but the friend obviously did not see the text. Since Natalia already knew about the sauna plan because Agata had told her about it, she skipped the place, and Piotr was injured. But the final nail for her is struck when she finds a message from Dagmara on Piotr's phone, reminding the man about the promise he had made to his boss.
While this promise was actually professional, regarding the new project, Natalia misunderstands it to be a personal message, suggesting that they were actually having an affair. Natalia calls Dagmara to the place for a confrontation, as the two women were actually acquaintances from their childhood days, and it is now that she learns of the real truth.This discovery also makes Natalia realize how Piotr was not actually against her, and so she rushes to the airfield where the skydiving activity was going on, wanting to stop Piotr from boarding the flight. Although she reaches the place late, Agata had actually failed to carry out this plan either, and so Piotr successfully lands, and the couple do reunite in love, apologizing for and forgiving all their silly mistakes.
During this time, Agata and Lukasz also found each other and got romantically involved. They met at a bar and had the same tattoo. It was in bed that Agata found out about the sauna plan from Lukasz, and it was because she was spending time with Lukasz that she forgot to place the faulty rope. The two friends actually had a plan to get their own benefits through shares from the lottery money, and this was why they were individually trying to end their friends' marriage. Finally, Lukasz and Agata even attack Piotr and Natalia while being severely drugged, and the couple realizes who has been at fault for this whole time.When Piotr had withdrawn the entire lottery money in cash and wanted to keep it at their house, he finally took the help of his neighbor Bogdan, who had been pestering the couple about buying a safe from him. Bogdan, a seller of private safes, had sold his products in the entire neighborhood, and Piotr also bought one of his safes to store all the money securely.
The couple returns home to find the entire stash of money missing from the safe. When the police report to the scene, they reveal that Bogdan was actually a known fraudster and criminal. Bogdan had sold the entire neighborhood his safes and then stolen all the wealth from his customers when he got the chance before fleeing the country. The money's temporary presence with the couple heals Piotr and Natalia's marriage. The two mend their relationship and stay together happily ever after.After some time, when they have decided to take their relationship to the next step, as Natalia is now pregnant. The couple has also opened a cafe with their own money, making it clear that they do not actually need the lottery money. Lukasz and Agata, who had apologized for their foolish behavior earlier, are now workers at the cafe, and they are indeed still in love as well.</p>

                            <p>Description: Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's (Jennifer Lopez) opinions on love and romance. Alida and Taroo tried to hide their love, but Alida's father found out. She was ordered to marry another from her own tribe. She prayed to the Gods to be rescued, who turn her into a red flower. Taroo begged the Gods to help him find Alida, and they turned him into a hummingbird.Artist reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover (Ben Affleck). Artist always wanted to be in love. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured. With the help of factory workers (the cells within her own body), she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide, but to no avail ("Hearts and Flowers").Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist (Fat Joe). He finds her dreams to be eccentric, which she blames on the conflicting astrological signs between him and his wife.The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra (Gilbert Saldivar); she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being ("Rebound").
Artists friends are The Cynic, The Idealist (Ashley Versher), The Realist (Malcolm Kelner), The Lover (Brandon Delsid), The Quiet One (Alix Angelis) and The Fighter (Danielle Larracuente).She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs (Aries (Jay Shetty), Taurus (Neil DeGrasse Tyson), Gemini (Jenifer Lewis), Cancer (Sofía Vergara), Leo (Post Malone), Virgo (Kim Petras), Libra (Trevor Noah), Scorpio (Keke Palmer), Sagittarius (Jane Fonda), Pisces (Sadhguru)), questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions.
Before they could piece together an answer, Artist enters three unsuccessful marriages with a Pisces (Tony Bellissimo), a Virgo (Derek Hough), and a Cancer (Trevor Jackson), respectively ("Can't Get Enough").The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance.
While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention. They believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices.
In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. Artist says that she believes in true love and that good things happen to good people.
Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story ("Broken Like Me"). Artist admits that she fears that she might be the reason behind her broken relationships.Artist returns home and burns old love letters and childhood memories while a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window.
As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike/The Cynic (Matthew Law), a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her.During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored ("This Is Me... Now"). Artist proves to herself that she only needs to love herself for her to be complete. The power of her conviction releases an energy that shoots off into the Universe and hits a bell at the Zodiacal council.With a new lease on life, Artist attends Mike's wedding alone and encounters several hummingbirds that lead her to her true love ("Midnight Trip to Vegas", "Hummingbird").</p>

                            <p>Description: From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic, MEAN GIRLS. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called "The Plastics," ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina's crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group's apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.—Paramount Pictures</p>

                            <p>Description: "Horizon" embarks on a vivid exploration of Earth's diverse ecosystems, starting with the rich marine life beneath the seas and moving through the vital mangroves, showcasing the interconnectedness of these habitats. The journey begins with a dive into the ocean's depths to admire its fauna and seabeds, then transitions to the mangroves where the importance of these ecosystems is highlighted through the lives of pelicans on Farasan Island and flamingos, emphasizing conservation efforts like waste cleaning and reforestation. The narrative then shifts from the serene beauty of the Farasan Islands at sunset to the harsh desert landscape, home to gazelles, ostriches, and bustards, all part of a crucial reintroduction project. The film climbs into the mountains to reveal vultures, ibex, and monkeys, culminating with the Arabian leopard's struggle for survival and reintroduction efforts. The documentary concludes at King Abdullah's University for Science and Technology, where innovative 3D scanning techniques are used to preserve coral reefs, encapsulating the film's overarching theme of the critical need for preservation and reintroduction across the planet's varied ecosystems.—Forward Films (SA)</p>

                            <p>Description: Regency England. Of the two Dashwood sisters of marriageable age, Elinor, as the oldest, is the sensible, practical one, and Marianne is the die-hard romantic. In keeping to her word to her dying father Henry to keep the family together and seeing the writing on the wall that her half-brother John will not keep to his word in falling prey to the control wielded by his money-hungry wife Fanny, Elinor makes arrangements for herself, her two sisters, and their mother to move to humble Barton Cottage in Devonshire, from their Sussex country manor on Norland Park in knowing that John and Fanny will take over the manor despite having their own home in London, and that John will renege on his promise to Henry to ensure that his half-sisters and stepmother will be taken care of financially. In Devonshire, Marianne attracts the romantic attention of two men, the first, Colonel Brandon, who she sees as unromantic unlike herself. As such, she favors the second, John Willoughby, who she sees as having the same romantic sensibilities as her. Elinor, on the other hand, sees her first priority to her sisters and mother, and thus puts her feelings for Edward Ferrars, Fanny's stepbrother, on the back burner. Despite Edward stating that he wants happiness in his life over any ambition, career or financial, a union between the two of them seems unlikely regardless in Fanny implying that her mother, Edward's stepmother, would disinherit him in marrying someone beneath him like Elinor in the Dashwood women having no money. Secrets kept by Edward, Colonel Brandon, and Willoughby will affect not only Elinor and Marianne's marriage prospects, but also how they view the men in their lives.—Huggo</p>

                            <p>Description: Girls from a shelter home in Munawwarpur are pimped out, and if something goes wrong, they are killed and cremated. The shelter home is run by Bansi, and his assistant is Sonu, who takes care of the operational details.When Vaishali (Bhumi Pednekar) was handed the social audit report by her informer, she thought it was useless material. She did not believe she had the power to stop the abuse that the girls at the shelter home in Munawwarpur were subjected to. Guptaji (Durgesh Kumar) was quite persistent about the case, and Vaishali took an interest when he mentioned that the police had not taken any action even though it had been two months since the report had been published. Vaishali started to investigate the case. Vaishali needs a strong story to keep her channel alive, else she will lose all viewers, and with it all sources of income.As soon as Vaishali started investigating, Bansi Sahu's (Aditya Srivastava) name cropped up too often. She meets Mithilesh Sinha, the head of Child Welfare Commission who says that he has no such information about the audit.
Sahu, a journalist himself, had a huge influence in the village of Munawwarpur. He contacted Vaishali's husband, Arvind (Surya Sharma), the minute he figured out that a journalist was inquiring about the shelter home. He indirectly threatened Vaishali to back off, but it instead intrigued her interest all the more.
Vaishali soon learned that Bansi Sahu had the support of the government. He bought printing papers at a subsidized rate but barely printed three copies. It was a daylight scam, and no one dared to question him. The shelter home belonged to him, and he was also associated with various other NGOs.
All the shelter homes of the state come under the purview of Ministry of Social Welfare, headed by Rajni Singh.
Everyone was afraid of Bansi Sahu, and the Chief Minister Jitesh Kumar (Anand Sharma) was also within his reach. Vaishali's mentor and cameraman, Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra), was a little shaken upon realizing that they would be challenging the government if they decided to expose the abuse and sex racket. Vaishali decided to continue with her investigation and find evidence that would support the claims made in the report.It was almost impossible to find anyone who could provide information about the Munawwarpur shelter home. They tried their best to track down anyone who had been relocated from the Munawwarpur shelter, but they remained unsuccessful. After inquiring at several shelter homes, they finally found hope at one where the cook previously worked at the Munawwarpur shelter home. When Vaishali and Bhaskar introduced themselves, Sudha (Tanisha Mehta) refused to utter a word. She denied knowing or seeing anything unlawful during her time there. Vaishali gave up and was about to leave when Sudha decided to confess the truth under one condition: she was not ready to go on record, and she did not want her name associated with the case.Sudha spoke about her haunting memories at the shelter home. She brought up Baby Rani (Gulista Alija), the shelter warden, and how she mistreated the girls. She used to force the girls to sleep naked while she assaulted them. The 40-45 girls at the shelter had only one room to sleep in, and their health condition was extremely poor.
One of the girls advised Sudha to run for her life, and she soon figured out the reason behind it. They had a doctor who took care of cases where the victims were injured to an extreme degree. Later, Sudha watched Bansi and his men party (including Mithilesh) at the shelter home, and they abused and tortured the girls at random. She realized she, too, would meet the same fate and decided to run away that very night. Before leaving, she heard Baby Rani and Sonu (Satyakam Anand) mention killing a girl they had pimped out.
The details left Vaishali and Bhaskar speechless. They were all the more determined to expose the perpetrators and rescue the victims. The only problem was that the only witness Vaishali had was not willing to come forward. She soon realized that even though there was a lack of evidence, she had to act confidently to force the abusers to react, and that would eventually lead to one blunder or another.When Vaishali learned that a PIL had been filed against the Munawwarpur shelter home, she assumed her brother-in-law, lawyer Suresh Singh (Danish Iqbal), was behind it. Suresh was completely against Vaishali's decision to look into Bansi Sahu's business. He always looked down upon the work she did, especially because she did not fit into the typical idea of a 'good Indian housewife.' Bansi's men also thought that Suresh was responsible for the PIL, and they roughed him up to teach Vaishali a lesson. Surprisingly, Arvind showed confidence in the work Vaishali had undertaken, and now that she had his support, it was impossible to deter her from exposing the criminals.Vaishali decided to constantly update her audience about the case, and she discussed the torture Suresh was subjected to and how the police refused to file an FIR against Bansi Sahu. Vaishali's small endeavor all of a sudden caught the attention of the common people as well as the influential. She approached the first female SSP of Munawwarpur, Jasmeet Gaur (Sai Tamhankar), to seek help. While Jasmeet was hopeful that she would find a solution, her senior advised her to stay out of it because of the lack of evidence in the case. The next time Jasmeet and Vaishali met, she helped her understand the importance of putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department. Only after Social Welfare Department files in FIR, can the Police do anything.
Meanwhile, it is revealed that it was Guptaji who filed the PIL in Patna High Court.Brijmohan Singh's (Pravin Kumar Sisodia) wife, Rajni Singh (Vibha Chibbar), headed the Social Welfare Department, but he was the one who made all decisions on her behalf. Brijmohan was one of Bansi's many clients, and they maintained a close relationship.
Vaishali realized that the only way she could put pressure on the Social Welfare Department was with believable lies. Bhaskar Sinha was assigned the task of pretending to be a well-wisher of Brijmohan. He managed to meet the politician and warned him of the evidence Vaishali had gathered against him and his wife. To instigate a misunderstanding between Bansi and his men, Bhaskar mentioned that Mithilesh Sinha (Chittaranjan Tripathy) from CWC was responsible for providing information to Vaishali.
Later that night, Vaishali discussed on her show the death of an officer from the Sitamarhi Social Welfare Department, and she believed that he was shot dead because he was putting pressure on the Social Welfare Department to look into the Munawwarpur shelter home case. With a white sheet in her hand, Vaishali claimed that she had every bit of information on how the Munawwarpur shelter home for girls operated. She stated that the next day, she would finally expose all the ministers and well-known personalities involved in the racket on her special program, Bhakshak.After the program was aired, the Chief Minister contacted Rajni Singh and instructed her to file an FIR immediately. Vaishali was hopeful that Jaspreet Gaur would be able to take the case forward from henceforth, but as it turned out, the FIR was filed in the woman's police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act. The Child Welfare Association would record the testimonies of the victim, and if they found anything worth investigating, action would be taken. Vaishali knew there was no hope because Bansi's close aide, Mithilesh Sinha, also a sexual predator, headed the Child Welfare Association. After speaking to the SSP, Vaishali realized that the only way to get the culprits behind bars was by gathering evidence.Vaishali decides to meet Sudha once again and convince her to come forward with her story. Sudha was not ready to endanger her life by becoming a witness in the case, but Vaishali helped her realize how she alone could save the lives of all the abused children. Sudha finally agreed to have her statement recorded. She stood before the camera with her face covered and narrated her entire experience.
Bansi and his associates realized it was the end of their free will. Bansi was an egoistic man, and he did not feel an ounce of shame for the heinous crime he committed. He did not allow Baby Rani and Sonu to throw away the bottles of alcohol and contraceptives stored at the shelter home. He was proud of himself, and he did not try to conceal the crime. Mithilesh walked away from Bansi, fearing losing his job. The next morning, police arrived at the Munawwarpur shelter home and rescued the girls. Bansi and his associates were arrested, and justice was finally served.Vaishali Singh addresses her audience, discussing how often the media fails to address issues of importance because of influence. At times, such cases are overlooked simply because they do not appeal to the audience as much as entertaining news does. She expresses her disappointment with the way the world functions, where there is a clear lack of emotion and sympathy, and people prefer to ignore rather than feel. Vaishali continues to play her part as a journalist, but she questions her audience, asking them if they are doing enough to be called human beings in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Description: Orion seems a lot like your average elementary school kid shy, unassuming, harboring a secret crush. But underneath his seemingly normal exterior, Orion is a ball of adolescent anxiety, completely consumed by irrational fears of bees, dogs, the ocean, cell phone waves, murderous gutter clowns, and even falling off of a cliff. But of all his fears, the thing he's the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grows closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.</p>

                            <p>Description: Ana (Camila Mendes) is an ambitious intern, dreaming of a career in the art world while trying to impress her demanding boss, Claire (Marisa Tomei) the head of Erwins New York. Ana hopes to earn Claire's recommendation to work at a top art gallery in New York. Claire is a sociopath perfectionist.
Because of the expensive cost of living in New York, Ana currently lives with her sister Vivian (Aimee Carrero) and Vivian's boyfriend Ronnie (Andrew Schulz), who has been urging her to move out.
Amy (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) is Ana's only friend at the office. During an auction at work, Ana realizes there has been a typo in the auction's catalog mislabeling the type of paint used on a piece that is about to be sold. Ana informs Claire of the error just in time to make the correction, gaining her a little respect. Claire fires Billy, the person who was in charge of the catalog.
The next morning Claire invites Ana to serve as the assistant to her assistants on an upcoming work trip to London. Claire asks Ana to pack her bags and to come straight to the airport.Upset by Ana's ambition, Claire's two assistants Suzette (Rachel Matthews) and Renee (Fola Evans-Akingbola) wait until the group is boarding their flight to reveal that they have booked Ana an economy ticket for a flight that leaves 4 hours later. The ticket agent at the check-in desk witnesses this mistreatment and decides to upgrade Ana's ticket to first class. While waiting for her flight in the first-class lounge Ana distractedly answers a phone call and proceeds to spill her Bloody Mary on a wealthy man named William (Archie Renaux). Ana and William end up sitting next to each other on the flight to London and hit it off. During the flight, Ana accidentally leads William to believe she is the art director of her company's New York office. He is very impressed and when they land, introduces Ana to his mother, Catherine (Lena Olin), who is a British celebrity. Catherine is introduced to Ana, and she offers to drop Ana at her hotel.
Catherine and Ana hit it off and she even takes Ana's number to stay in touch.Suzette and Renee continue to sabotage Ana, assigning her an office in the basement and a room at a separate cheaper hotel, while they stay at the Carlson, a swanky hotel 4 streets from William's home.
Arnold (Thomas Kretschmann) is the head of the company and is leading the sale of the prestigious Brovil collection, whose owner is known only to Arnold. Arnold has brought in Gerard (head of Paris office) and Claire to overlook the sale and ensure its success. Arnold is due to retire, which means both Gerard and Claire are up for the top job.
Ana receives a voicemail informing her that she left her laptop in Williams's car. That night she goes to Catherine's house to retrieve her laptop and finds herself in the middle of a party. There she sees Catherine's extensive art collection (which belonged to her husband, who passed away), meets a famous painter, and continues to lie about being the director of a New York auction house named Erwins.
Ana tells Catherine that her husband was a romantic, since his art collection tells a story of love. Catherine reveals that she recently asked Erwins to auction her collection. Her last name is Brovil. Catherine says that she is working with Claire and says that she will ask Arnold to work with Ana instead. Ana says that the sale is a secret, and she would get in trouble if Arnold found out that she was talking to Catherine.Suzette and Renee are tasked with getting last-minute tickets to a performance of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while continuing to assign Ana to all of the work they don't want to do. Desperate to get tickets to impress Claire, Ana asks Catherine who leaves tickets with William. Ana visits William who is coaching an at-risk youth soccer league. William invites her to have lunch with him which she has to decline due to her workload. William also tells her that there is a party being thrown that evening and his mother, Catherine, wants Ana to attend. Before Ana leaves, Will clarifies that he would also like her to attend, as his date.Ana runs back to the London office and arrives just as Claire asks Suzette if she got the tickets. Suzette is forced to admit that she was not able to and is further embarrassed when Ana shows her up and turns in the tickets to Claire. Background tensions rise as Gerard (Gregory Montel), the art director for the Paris office, and Claire are both vying for the company's head director position.Ana attends the party, with William and Catherine, in a designer dress that she "borrowed" from Claire (Claire had given the dress to Ana for dry-cleaning). Catherine admits to Ana that she is having second thoughts about selling her collection, due to the love of her husband that it represents.
When she suddenly sees Claire arrive with Suzette and Renee, she is scared her lie will be revealed and attempts to run off. Will catches her before she leaves and instead takes her to go dancing at a local bar. At the end of the night, William wants to take Ana back to her hotel. Embarrassed by where she is actually staying, Ana has William drop her off at Claire's much nicer hotel and makes an excuse to prevent him from coming inside. Before leaving, William confesses that he is falling in love with her.Over the next week, Ana and William continue to spend time together, growing closer and developing their relationship. William tells Ana that he has spent his whole life being used by other people but that she is different, and he admires her for being down-to-earth and humble despite her wealth and success. He tells her he knows her job is important and that he has arranged to transfer his work to New York so that they can continue their relationship.At the office, Claire praises Ana's hard work and promises that there will be a promotion in her future. Renee interrupts their meeting to reveal that a major client has just pulled out of their upcoming auction. That client is Catherine, William's mother. At that same moment, William arrives to surprise Ana at work, and she rushes him out of the building. William tells Ana that he had nothing to do with his mother's decision and doesn't understand why she is acting so strange. He questions whether Ana was just using him to secure his mother's sale and breaks up with her.When Ana goes back into the building, she is confronted by Claire who has discovered her lie and her relationship with William's family. She is fired and escorted out of the building.Ana visits Catherine and confesses that she is not the successful art director she was pretending to be. Instead of being upset, Catherine is proud of Ana for her honesty. She says that she was also using Ana by pretending to walk away from the auction to get a better deal from Erwins who had offered her 85 million pounds for her collection.
Catherine agrees to rejoin the auction on the condition that Ana is the one who handles the sale. Ana kicks Gerard off the auction and puts Claire in total control. Ana is re-hired and manages to sell Catherine's art for much more than expected (250 million pounds). She goes back to the soccer field and apologizes to William who tells her that he didn't like her because she was rich, he liked her because he thought she was an honest person.Ana returns to New York and six months later she has not heard from William but is thriving in her career. Ana throws a party to celebrate the opening of her own art gallery. At the end of the night, after everyone else has left, William arrives with a suitcase.</p>

                            <p>Description: Specializing in the works of Jane Austen, Dr. Eloise Cavendish is the keynote speaker at this year's Jane Austen League of America (JALA) conference and ball. This annual event is only the second time she's ever attended as, as an academic through and through, she doesn't much like the "ball" component, with many attendees treating JALA like one big Regency costume party. She doesn't even really see Austen, as most do, as a romance novelist in her rather clinical perspective. In addition to being able to visit with Mia Cavendish, her drama queen of a sister at the same time in Mia living in town, Eloise primarily accepted the invitation to meet and impress Dr. Victoria Jennings, one of the event organizers who is part of the hiring committee for a job at Princeton, a job Eloise would very much like. Unlike most, single Eloise is dismayed literally to meet "Mr. Darcy", he really Sam Lee, someone hired to dress and act like Mr. Darcy to provide some color to JALA. Her dismay is that Sam is doing double duty as her special guest liaison to JALA, including immersing her into what is somewhat expected of her in the "costume party" aspect. Eloise hates to admit that she needs Sam's help to impress Dr. Jennings, while she in turn helps him with a somewhat personal matter also associated to Dr. Jennings. The question becomes whether Eloise and Sam can bridge their differences in helping each other.—Huggo</p>
